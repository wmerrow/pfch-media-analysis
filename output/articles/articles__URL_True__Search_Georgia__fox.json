    "article_text": "Trump urges Georgia to vote in Senate runoffs at rally, still hits 'rigged' election With the Republican majority on the line in Georgia's Senate runoffs, President Trump returned\u00a0to the campaign trail Saturday for the first time since last month\u2019s presidential election. Along with first lady Melania Trump, he gave a night rally in Valdosta, Ga., for Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Trump described to the crowd how he saw the stakes\u00a0in the twin Senate runoffs.\u00a0 \"Very simply, you will decide whether your children will grow up in a socialist country or free country. Socialism is just the beginning for these people. They want to\u00a0go into a communistic form of government,\" the president continued.\u00a0 Trump said that Perdue's opponent, Jon Ossoff, and Loeffler's opponent, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, are the \"two most extreme, far-left, liberal candidates in history.\"\u00a0 Trump implored Georgians to vote, while still sowing distrust in the state's handling of elections.\u00a0 \"You must go vote, vote early. They cheated, they rigged our presidential election, but we will still win it. They're going to try and rig this election too.\" Trump then hit the state's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. \"Your governor could stop it very easily, if he knew what the hell he was doing.\" He said that Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger were \"afraid of Stacey Abrams,\" the former Democratic gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist.\u00a0 \"If I lost, I'd be a very gracious loser. If I lost, I'd go to Florida...but you can't ever accept what they steal and rig and rob. You can't accept it,\" Trump continued.\u00a0 Of the 2024 presidential election, Trump said, \"Hopefully, I\u00a0won't have to be a candidate.\" Just after the rally, the president took to Twitter to urge Georgians to register to vote before Monday, Dec. 12, and to request an absentee ballot before 12/31.\u00a0 \"The answer to the Democrat voter fraud is not to stay at home - that\u2019s what Pelosi and Schumer want you to do. If you want revenge on the Democrats for their efforts to steal the Presidential election, where we are fighting hard, you have to show up and vote in RECORD numbers!\" he added.\u00a0 Crowds of supporters lined up for hours\u00a0to attend the rally. Some even camped overnight, despite temperatures dropping to the mid-30s. As the\u00a0mostly maskless supporters stood in line waiting for temperature checks, a chant broke out: \"Stop the steal.\"\u00a0 On the eve of Trump\u2019s trip, Vice President Mike Pence -- in the Peach State for the second time since the kickoff of the twin Senate showdowns -- emphasized: \u201cPresident Trump and I need David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler back in the Republican majority in the United States Senate.\u201d BIDEN, OBAMA, PENCE, AND TRUMP WEIGH IN ON GEORGIA RUNOFFS Loeffler and Perdue are the\u00a0GOP candidates in the Jan. 5 elections, which will determine if Republicans hold the chamber, or if\u00a0Democrats control both the House and Senate, as well as the White House. AD SPENDING IN GEORGIA'S TWIN RUNOFF ELECTIONS SKYROCKETS \u00a0 Republicans desperately need Trump supporters to return to the polls a month from now, despite unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud in the Nov. 3 election. The balance of power for the next Senate coming out of last month\u2019s elections is 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats. That\u00a0means\u00a0Democrats must win both of Georgia\u2019s runoffs to make it a 50-50 split Senate. If that occurs, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote, giving her party a\u00a0razor-thin majority in the chamber. GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS SPUR PROBE INTO THIRD-PARTY GROUPS TRYING TO REGISTER OUT-OF-STATE VOTERS In Georgia, where state law dictates a runoff if no candidate garners\u00a050% of the vote, Perdue narrowly missed\u00a0avoiding a runoff, winning 49.75% of the vote. Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff\u00a0trailed by roughly 87,000 votes. In the other race, Loeffler captured nearly 26% of the vote in a whopping 20-candidate special election to fill the final two years of the term of former GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson. Democratic candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock won nearly 33% of the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important that Republicans are united in this fight against Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff,\u201d said Jesse Hunt, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the re-election arm of the Senate GOP.\u00a0 \u201cIt may sound clich\u00e9, but with two very consequential runoffs, turnout is critical.\u201d Hunt told Fox News that \u201cthe president\u2019s visit is going to be an event that energizes and mobilizes our Republican voters.\u201d The visit comes on the eve of Sunday\u2019s debate between Loeffler and Warnock, which will be\u00a0carried live nationally on Fox News. Trump continues to fight the results of the presidential contest in Georgia, a once solidly red state that\u2019s turned into a crucial battleground in recent years. President-elect Joe Biden carried the state by roughly 12,000 votes in last month\u2019s election. The results were backed up by a manual recount mandated by state officials. A second recount requested by the president, completed Friday, didn\u2019t alter the final result \u2013 and the election results were cerrtified. But as Biden prepares to take office, Trump has continued his assault\u00a0on the election. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE GEORGIA RUNOFFS The president this week tweeted or retweeted baseless charges of voter fraud in Georgia, and he\u2019s repeatedly attacked\u00a0Kemp and\u00a0 Raffensperger, who are both Trump supporters, for their refusal to\u00a0reverse the election results.  Conspiratorial claims by pro-Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Lin Wood this week further\u00a0roiled the waters. They filed lawsuits seeking to overturn Georgia\u2019s results. At a rally Wednesday, they went further, urging\u00a0GOP voters to not support Perdue and Loeffler, charging that the senators have not been supportive enough of Trump's\u00a0efforts to overturn the election. \u201cThey have not earned your vote. Don\u2019t you give it to them,\u201d Wood said. \u201cWhy would you go back and vote in another rigged election, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d That\u2019s got plenty of Republicans in Georgia pushing back. Former House Speaker and 2012 presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, who represented Georgia in Congress for decades, tweeted this week:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLin Wood and Sidney Powell are totally destructive. Every Georgia conservative who cares about America MUST vote in the runoff.\u201d Gabriel Sterling, a top Georgia election official and a Republican, predicted that voter fraud allegations\u00a0by Trump and his allies will\u00a0drive down GOP turnout in the Senate runoffs. \u201cAt this point, there\u2019s no way that it can\u2019t,\u201d he told CNN in an interview this week. On Friday, as his legal team filed a new lawsuit in Georgia, Trump tied the runoffs to his push to reverse the state\u2019s presidential election results as he once again demanded a signature audit of ballots. \u201cThe best way to insure a @KLoeffler and @sendavidperdue VICTORY is to allow signature checks in the Presidential race, which will insure a Georgia Presidential win,\u201d the president claimed. And he argued that \u201cSpirits will soar and everyone will rush out and VOTE!\u201d But ahead of the president\u2019s trip, a dozen and a half leading Georgia Republicans issued a statement urging that the focus turn from attacks over the Nov. 3 results to the Senate runoffs. \u201cWe have watched with increasing concern as the debate surrounding the state\u2019s electoral\u00a0system has made some within our Party consider whether voting in the coming run-off election\u00a0matters, \" the statement read.\u00a0\u00a0\"We say today, without equivocation, that without every vote cast for President Trump\u00a0and all our Republican candidates on November 3 also being cast in the U.S. Senate runoffs, the\u00a0trajectory of our State and Nation will be irreparably altered on January 5th.\u00a0Now is the time to unite our Party and win these U.S. Senate seats.\" Among those signing the statement were former Republican Sens.\u00a0Isakson, Saxby Chambliss and Mack Mattingly, and former GOP Gov. Nathan Deal.",

    "article_text": "Georgia county recertifies election results, rejecting fraud claims tied to viral video One\u00a0Georgia\u00a0county recertified its election results on Friday as Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office debunked a recently surfaced video that appeared to show illegal ballot-counting without supervisors. The Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections adjourned a meeting Friday in which members voted to recertify the results of the 2020 presidential race in favor of President-elect Joe Biden in a 3-2 voice vote. Much of the meeting focused on a video that went viral Thursday, which political commentators claimed showed Fulton County election officials illegally stuffing ballots -- a form of election fraud in which more ballots are counted than were cast by eligible voters in a specific location. A senior source in Raffensperger's office\u00a0told\u00a0Fox\u00a0News that the video has\u00a0been investigated and claims that it showed ballot fraud deemed unfounded, adding that Fulton County election officials had a designated observer at the location the entire time -- a practice that has been in place since June. Raffensperger's office\u00a0also debunked allegations that the ballots were stuffed in\u00a0a pair of \"suitcases\" that one election official pulled out from beneath a table in the video, saying footage shows the ballots in the cases that they were supposed to be kept in.\u00a0 HANNITY ON SUSPICIOUS SUITCASE VIDEO Republican Georgia Rep. Jody Hice, however, shared the video on Twitter, calling the footage \"explosive fraud.\" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said during a Thursday interview on \"The Ingraham Angle\"\u00a0that\u00a0he has called for a signature audit into the video, but only the secretary of state has the power to order one. COLLINS IMPLORES GOP VOTERS TO TURN OUT FOR GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS: 'PEOPLE CANNOT GIVE UP ON THE SYSTEM' Georgia\u00a0election chief Gabe Sterling shared a fact-check article from a news outlet called Lead Stories in a Thursday tweet, saying, \"The 90-second video of election workers at State Farm arena, purporting to show fraud was watched in its entirety (hours) by\u00a0@GaSecofState investigators. Shows normal ballot processing. Here is the fact check on it.\" Fulton County Elections Director Richard Barron told the Board of Registration and Elections during Friday's hearing that he had not seen the video, but his staff told him the footage showed \"normal\" activity. Barron took questions from\u00a0Republican board members Kathleen Ruth and\u00a0Mark Wingate, who voted against certifying election results. In response to claims that staff and media left the counting site early, Barron said no one was told to leave early and that certain staff left after their duties concluded. Democratic board member Aaron Johnson said\u00a0the board needs to\u00a0\"sit down, look at what actually happened\" and do what they can to\u00a0\"find out what happened.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The deadline for all counties to complete their recounts was midnight Wednesday.

    "article_text": "Who are the groups at the center of the Georgia election investigation? A group at the center of the investigation into voter fraud recently opened by the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger hired contractors who were found to have forged ballot applications in 2014. The group, The New Georgia Project, was founded by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams to help register new voters. Ultimately, the 2014 investigation found no wrongdoing by the group, but did cite 14 people for forging 53 voter applications. All those cited were working as independent contractors, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. On Wednesday, Raffensperger announced an investigation into several progressive organizations he alleged \u201csought to register ineligible, out-of-state, or deceased voters\u201d for the Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections. Among those named are Vote Forward, The New Georgia Project, Operation Voter Registration GA and America Votes. GEORGIA GROUP FOUNDED BY STACEY ABRAMS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR SEEKING OUT-OF-STATE, DEAD VOTERS \u201cI have issued clear warnings several times to groups and individuals working to undermine the integrity of elections in Georgia through false and fraudulent registrations,\u201d said Raffensperger in a statement. \u201cThe security of Georgia\u2019s elections is of the utmost importance. We have received specific evidence that these groups have solicited voter registrations from ineligible individuals who have passed away or live out of state. I will investigate these claims thoroughly and take action against anyone attempting to undermine our elections.\u201d The New Georgia Project, which was led by Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock until February, is accused by Raffensperger of several election violations. Almost all of them involve sending voter registration or absentee application mail to people who were either deceased or ineligible to vote. The progressive nonprofit was founded in 2013 and works to build the progressive voting bloc in Georgia largely by registering young people to vote. In the 2018 election cycle, the New Georgia Project reported $96,000 in payments, with two payments worth a total of $35,000 going to the Working Families Party. FLORIDA ATTORNEY UNDER INVESTIGATION AFTER SAYING HE IS MOVING TO GEORGIA TO VOTE Vote Forward is a nonprofit founded by Scott Forman in 2017. The progressive group focuses on sending handwritten letters imploring people to vote. According to OpenSecrets, a campaign finance database, the organization had no filings for 2020 and raised just over $50,000 in 2018. Forman, like many on the medium, has made a number of inflammatory Tweets about President Trump and his supporters. He insinuated the president is a \u201cwould-be dictator\u201d and called his supporters deplorables. Raffensperger alleged that Vote Forward sent a letter to a deceased person encouraging them to vote. PRO-TRUMP ATTORNEYS SIDNEY POWELL, LIN WOOD URGE GEORGIANS NOT TO VOTE IN SENATE RUNOFFS WITHOUT CHANGES America Votes is a much larger operation, conducting voter education and mobilization efforts in 20 states. In his announcement, Raffensperger accused the progressive nonprofit of sending two absentee ballot applications in one week to an old address of a Georgia voter. During the 2020 election cycle, according to campaign finance data, the nonprofit amassed more than $15 million in donations. The group\u00a0dispersed money to a number of progressive political action committees. The investigation is a formal acknowledgement that there was some impropriety in the voting process, though both sides of the aisle understand it\u2019s nowhere near enough to upend Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state. Raffensperger\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The announcement comes about a month before two critical runoff Senate elections in Georgia, the results of which will determine the partisan balance of power in Congress during Biden\u2019s presidency.",

    "article_text": "Georgia Rep.-elect Carolyn Bourdeaux, only Democrat to flip seat, says party should talk to Trump supporters Georgia Rep.-elect Carolyn\u00a0Bourdeaux fell just 433 votes shy of becoming a congresswoman in 2018 in the tightest House\u00a0race in the country. But two years later, the college professor and public policy expert mounted a comeback by beating GOP emergency room physician\u00a0Rich McCormick by more than 10,000 votes and becoming the first woman to represent Georgia's 7th Congressional District. Her win in\u00a0November in\u00a0suburban Atlanta was a\u00a0major bright spot for House Democrats who otherwise had a tough 2020 election by losing unexpected seats and shrinking their majority. Bourdeaux arrived in Washington, D.C., recently for congressional orientation as the only Democrat to flip a red seat in earnest. Bourdeaux said the key for Democrats having future success will be to\u00a0listen to non-Democrats\u00a0as well. \"We need to pay a lot of attention to the\u00a0diverse communities of this country,\" Bourdeaux\u00a0told Fox News in an interview in\u00a0Washington, \"and that diversity includes people who supported Trump and people who are\u00a0not in our camp. One of the things I did over and over was just sit and listen to people.\" REP.-ELECT CARLOS GIMENEZ, FORMER MIAMI-DADE MAYOR, CONDEMNS OTHER MAYORS THAT 'ALLOWED MOB RULE' Democrats picked up two more open\u00a0House seats in North Carolina because of new congressional district maps. But\u00a0Bourdeaux remains the only Democrat to flip an existing red district blue. Meanwhile, Republicans flipped a dozen seats from blue to red and weakened the Democrats' majority. Bourdeaux credits her\u00a0win to putting in the work of building the Democratic Party infrastructure of registering voters, especially in the Asian American community, to the mobilizing efforts of\u00a0young organizers and meeting with people of all backgrounds. She said she visited mosques, synagogues and churches,\u00a0talked to the local Rotary Club, Chamber of Commerce\u00a0and Black fraternities and sororities to brainstorm solutions on issues important to them. She focused her campaign on universal messages of improving health care, fighting the coronavirus\u00a0and getting people back to work and school. \"It's a combination of message and then work,\" Bourdeaux said of her success in a traditionally Republican area of Georgia.\u00a0 The 2020 election delivered mixed results, with Joe Biden winning the White House and Georgia -- the first time a Democrat carried the Peach State since Bill Clinton in 1992. But Democrats lost seats in the House, and Biden's only hope of having Democrats control the Senate is by winning twin runoff elections on Jan. 5 in Georgia.\u00a0 REP.-ELECT LAUREN BOEBERT PLANS THANKSGIVING 'FUNERAL' FOR DEAD TURKEY IN DEFIANCE OF COLORADO GUIDELINES \"It was a double wave election where both sides really turned out in huge numbers,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said. \"I don't know if there's anything clear except that we are a purple nation.\u00a0... We're just going to have to find a way to focus on the problem and then work together to find a solution.\u201d Top of her list is\u00a0solving the coronavirus crisis and\u00a0improving health care.\u00a0It's\u00a0unacceptable that so many middle-class families are priced out of buying health care and those with insurance still can't afford to pay for prescription drugs or cover\u00a0their medical bills, she said. Health care problems hit close to home. Her\u00a0parents' health care costs become so expensive, they drained their bank accounts and couldn't afford to\u00a0pay for their medications. Bourdeaux's mother cared for her sick father for 10 years\u00a0until both her parents passed away in 2017, she said. \"I have my own personal story. My\u00a0father was sick for a decade. My mother took care of him and all of their discretionary income was eaten up paying for his prescription medications,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said. REP.-ELECT TONY GONZALES HELPS GOP HOLD TEXAS BORDER DISTRICT: 'MY STORY IS THE AMERICAN DREAM' In talking to a range of voters over the years, she saw that health care struggles are too common. \"I think everybody had a health care horror story,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said, relaying stories of maternity care and unexpected billing.\u00a0 \"I cannot believe we allow this to happen to us. And so those are the kind of things that we need to fix and ... I'm already talking to people about working in a bipartisan fashion.\" Growing up in Roanoke, Va., as the daughter of educators,\u00a0Bourdeaux earned admission to\u00a0Yale University where she got her\u00a0bachelor's degree\u00a0with the help of\u00a0grants and federal loans. She went on to receive a master's in public administration from the University of Southern California and a Ph.D. in public administration from Syracuse University. Bourdeaux, 50, is an associate professor at Georgia State University teaching classes centered on\u00a0public service, policy\u00a0and budgeting. She's a wife and mother to an 8-year-old son. ASHLEY HINSON, FORMER TV NEWS ANCHOR, IS LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS \u2014 NOT TO 'LAUNCH FIREBOMBS' IN CONGRESS She brings to Washington a deep policy expertise\u00a0that she wants to put to use to find bipartisan solutions, especially on health care. She previously\u00a0tackled legislative issues in Washington, D.C., as an aide to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and was the\u00a0former director of the nonpartisan Georgia Senate Budget Office where she worked with both parties to balance the budget during the Great Recession.\u00a0 \"I had solved problems during the last\u00a0worst crisis this country had faced and I had done it\u00a0in\u00a0a bipartisan basis. I got the job done for people,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said.\u00a0 In contrast to the Democratic socialist wing of the party, Bourdeaux takes a more measured approach to health care, policing, free college tuition and more. She wants to improve the Affordable Care Act and add\u00a0a public option but doesn't back \"Medicare for all.\" She didn't run on the Green New Deal; instead, she talks of having a Marshall Plan level of investment in clean-energy jobs and building up a green transit system. \"I'm very interested in ... having a big infrastructure investment,\" Bourdeaux said. \"We need it anyway. If\u00a0you've driven through Atlanta, we have soul-sucking commutes and horrific traffic.\" Bourdeaux thinks police departments may actually need more funding, not less, to support better\u00a0training and community policing programs.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I have never said defund the police,\" she said. \"That's just a made-up argument and it takes away from a very important conversation we need to be having about race.\" REP.-ELECT DIANA HARSHBARGER SAYS CONGRESS IS NO MATCH 'FOR A WOMAN WHO CAN MULTITASK' As a college professor, Bourdeaux understands firsthand the struggles students face trying to pay\u00a0for school but says families\u00a0need to have some skin in the game.\u00a0\"I believe in affordable.

You see the Capitol building and you're like: 'I\u00a0can't believe\u00a0I'm going to have the privilege of working there.' It truly is very, very moving.\"",

    "article_text": "Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger investigating 250 cases connected to election Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Monday said his office is investigating more than 250 claims of voting irregularities connected\u00a0with the November election. \u00a0 Speaking to reporters from the state Capitol Monday, Raffensperger said his office is investigating any credible claims that\u00a0groups are working to register ineligible people to vote ahead of a high-profile runoff election for Georgia's two U.S. Senate seats. He\u00a0said his office's 23 investigators are also continuing\u00a0to look into allegations of problems with absentee ballots, as well as claims of people who voted twice, people who cast a ballot in a dead person's name, and non-residents who voted in Georgia. Gabriel Sterling, a top official in Raffensperger's office, said more than 250 cases have been opened, but there has been nothing so far that jumps out as being likely to change the outcome of the election.  Raffensperger\u00a0also hit back at allegations of widespread fraud, saying those that perpetuate them \u201care exploiting the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation and, frankly, they're misleading the president as well, apparently.\u201d  DISTRICT JUDGE HALTS 3 GEORGIA COUNTIES FROM ERASING DOMINION VOTING MACHINE DATA The secretary of state's office is looking into a sworn statement from a Republican official in Gwinnett County, in Atlanta's northeastern suburbs, that says there were more absentee ballots than absentee ballot envelopes, Raffensperger said. \"This is the kind of specific charge that our office can investigate and ascertain the truth,\" he said. County election workers around the state are currently working on a recount of the presidential race that was requested by the Trump campaign, and Raffensperger said he expects them to finish by the Wednesday night deadline. Under state law, the losing candidate can request a recount when the margin is less than 0.5%. Certified results showed Trump losing to Biden by 12,670 votes, or 0.25%. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The recount, which is being done using scanners that read and tabulate votes, is the third time the votes in the presidential race are being counted in Georgia. After the initial count following Election Day, Raffensperger selected the presidential race for an audit required by state law. Because of the tight margin, he said, the audit required the roughly 5 million votes in that contest to be recounted by hand. The Associated Press contributed to this report. ",

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced to reporters on Monday that \"we have opened an investigation into a group called America Votes, who is sending absentee ballot applications to people at addresses where they have not lived since 1994.\" DONALD TRUMP JR. TO STAR IN NEW ADS IN GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF CAMPAIGN Raffensperger, a Republican, also said his investigators are looking into \"Vote Forward, who attempted to register a dead Alabama voter, a woman, to vote here in Georgia.\"\u00a0He also spotlighted \"The New Georgia Project, who sent voter registration applications to New York City.\" The secretary of state also pinpointed \u201cOperation New Voter Registration Georgia, who is telling college students in Georgia that they can change their residency to Georgia and then change it back after the election.\u201d Raffensperger emphasized that \u201cvoting in Georgia when you\u2019re not a resident of Georgia is a felony. And encouraging college students to commit felonies without regard for what it might mean for them is despicable. These third-party groups have a responsibility not to encourage illegal voting. If they do so, they will be held responsible.\u201d Raffensperger's office also has 23 investigators working on 250 open investigations into \"credible claims of illegal voting\" and election law violations, he said. Gabriel Sterling, the election official who manages Georgia\u2019s voting system, told reporters that \u201cthis is new information, these outside groups attempting to register people illegally potentially, in other states.\u201d Sterling said that these third-party groups appear to be \u201cliterally saying \u2018hey, it\u2019s OK to commit a felony.\u2019\u201d GEORGIA EXTENDS USE OF ABSENTEE BALLOT DROP BOXES IN STATE'S RUNOFF ELECTIONS And Raffensperger emphasized that \u201cthis office will continue to take steps to protect the voting rights of the legally registered Georgians of this state, Republican, Democrat, independent, and whatever party you may be a member of.\u201d The current balance of power for the next Senate coming out of this month\u2019s elections is 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats. That means\u00a0Democrats must win both of Georgia\u2019s runoff elections to make it a 50-50 Senate. If that occurs, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote, giving her party a\u00a0razor-thin majority in the chamber. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In Georgia, where state law dictates a runoff if no candidate reaches 50% of the vote, GOP\u00a0Sen.\u00a0David Perdue narrowly missed\u00a0avoiding a runoff, winning 49.75% of the vote. Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff\u00a0trails by roughly 87,000 votes. In the other race, appointed Republican\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Kelly Loeffler captured nearly 26% of the vote in a whopping 20-candidate special election to fill the final two years of the term of former GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson. The Democratic candidate in the runoff, Rev. Raphael Warnock, won nearly 33% of the vote in the first round.",

    "article_text": "Trump presses 'hapless' Georgia governor to overrule secretary of state on signature matching President Trump called on Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to override Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on matching signatures during the state's recount, in a tweet Monday. Raffensperger has said that matching the signature on the outer envelope to the absentee ballot on the inside is impossible, because the ballots are separated from the envelopes when they are opened to protect voter privacy. The Trump campaign, which formally asked for a recount Nov. 22, says that \"without signature-matching, this recount would be a sham and again allow for illegal votes to be counted.\" Georgia certified President-elect Joe Biden as the winner on Nov. 20. \"Why won\u2019t Governor\u00a0@BrianKempGA, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes,\" Trump tweeted Monday. \"It will be a 'goldmine'\u00a0of fraud, and we will easily WIN the state.\" \"Also, quickly check the number of envelopes versus the number of ballots,\" he continued. \"You may just find that there are many more ballots than there are envelopes. So simple, and so easy to do. Georgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done!\" JUDGE HALTS 3 ATLANTA-AREA COUNTIES FROM ERASING DOMINION VOTING MACHINE DATA The tweets come a day after Trump told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that he is \"ashamed\" he endorsed Kemp during his 2018 race against Democrat Stacey Abrams. Georgia Sens. Kelly Loeffler\u00a0and David Perdue, two Republicans involved in runoff races, have backed the president's signature-matching demands and\u00a0called\u00a0for Raffensperger's resignation. But emergency rules that were adopted ahead of the presidential election explicitly require,\u00a0in order to\u00a0preserve the secrecy of each individual vote as laid out in Georgia law and the\u00a0Georgia Constitution, that ballots be separated from\u00a0their envelopes so\u00a0they cannot possibly be joined back together. GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE SOUNDS ALARM AHEAD OF RUNOFF ELECTIONS An emergency rule that was\u00a0adopted earlier this year\u00a0mandates that every absentee ballot goes through signature verification but that after the signature is verified the ballot itself is separated from the outer envelope with the signature. After the Trump criticism, Raffensperger said Monday that \"dishonest actors\" are spreading \"massive amounts of misinformation.\" \"There are those who are exploiting the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation, and frankly they are misleading the president as well apparently,\" he said during a Monday statement to reporters. \"We will continue to investigation credible claims of illegal voting and violation of state election law,\" he continued. \"There are currently over 250 open cases from 2020 and we have 23 investigators to follow up on that.\" In a Monday letter, the Trump campaign again asked Raffensperger to audit the signatures on absentee ballots and envelopes in all Georgia counties.

The deadline to complete the recount is Dec. 2. \u00a0 Joe Biden defeated President Trump\u00a0by about 13,000\u00a0votes\u00a0in the Peach State, but Trump and his legal team have challenged the results. Trump has expressed frustration with state leaders over how both the\u00a0election and vote count were handled and has been\u00a0vocal in his criticism of top Republicans in the state. Trump told Fox News on Sunday that Gov. Brian Kemp has done \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d to question the results and\u00a0has\u00a0also called Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d for allowing what he called\u00a0a \u201cfraudulent system\u201d to persist\u00a0in the state. Raffensperger certified the election result on Nov. 20, and Kemp signed off on it. WSB-TV pointed\u00a0to an op-ed that Raffensperger wrote last week where he said the election seemed as though it was \u201cwildly successful\u201d and \"smooth.\u201d \u201cThis should be something for Georgians to celebrate, whether their favored presidential candidate won or lost. For those wondering, mine lost \u2014 my family voted for him, donated to him, and are now being thrown under the bus by him,\u201d he wrote. GEORGIA INVESTIGATES FLOODING THAT DELAYED VOTE COUNTING The 11Alive report said the server that crashed was newly purchased but additional details were not immediately clear. Emails from Fox News to Dominion and Raffensperger were not immediately returned. Trump and his supporters have insisted that he won the election and it is only due to widespread fraud that Biden was declared the winner. Trump's critics say he clearly lost and has yet to provide evidence to suggest the contrary.\u00a0 Trump said in an interview Sunday that his Department of Justice has been \u201cmissing in action.\u201d\u00a0He also questioned the whereabouts\u00a0of the FBI. \u201cYou would think if you\u2019re in the FBI or Department of Justice, this is the biggest thing you could be looking at. Where are they? I\u2019ve not seen anything,\u201d he said. Last week, Michael Steel, a spokesman for Dominion denied claims that vote cast through the company\u2019s systems were at risk of being altered. He said it is physically impossible to alter votes in the system. DERSHOWITZ: TRUMP HAS 'CONSTITUTIONAL PATHS' TO PURSUE IN COURT CASES, WILL LIKELY COME UP SHORT \"Look, when a voter votes on a Dominion machine, they fill out a ballot on a touch screen. They are given a printed copy which they then give to a local election official for safekeeping. If any electronic interference had taken place, the tally reported electronically would not match the printed ballots. and in every case where we've looked\u00a0at -- in Georgia, all across the country -- the printed ballot, the gold standard in election security, has matched the electronic tally,\"\u00a0he said. Trump\u2019s campaign launched several lawsuits challenging the voting systems and processes in a number of key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
