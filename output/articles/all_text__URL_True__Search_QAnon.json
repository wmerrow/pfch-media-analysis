    "org_text": "Conspiracy theories, explained    Eleanor\u2019s dad loved science \u2014 or so she thought. Eleanor grew up listening to stories of the Apollo missions and audio clips from space expeditions. Every weekend, the two of them hopped on a train to downtown Philadelphia to visit the Franklin Institute, where they would explore the planetarium, flight simulators, and technology exhibits.  \u201cIt was our special thing,\u201d Eleanor, now an elementary school teacher who requested that Vox not use her real name to protect her privacy, told me. That was several years ago. In 2020, Eleanor began to glimpse a much different version of her father.  \u201cI\u2019m going to a protest,\u201d he told her in April. At first, she assumed he was attending a Black Lives Matter march or a similar event. But no \u2014 her father was protesting to reopen the state of Pennsylvania, then under lockdown due to Covid-19, because he thought the governor was exaggerating the threat of the virus. Other dissonant moments followed. Eleanor\u2019s father didn\u2019t just disagree with Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf \u2014 suddenly, Wolf was \u201ca dictator.\u201d Her father started following fringe communities and groups online, arguing that masks were \u201ca muzzle and a control device,\u201d a way for the government to somehow manipulate the populace. Then he began enthusiastically repeating the false claims of Stella Immanuel, a Houston pediatrician who went viral earlier this year for claiming hydroxychloroquine could \u201ccure\u201d Covid-19. (Immanuel has also declared, among other things, that ovarian cysts are caused by sex with demons, that scientists are experimenting with alien DNA, and that reptilian humanoids are running the government.) Once, when Immanuel appeared on a TV news segment, Eleanor\u2019s father and stepmother began cheering, as though they were at a political rally instead of at home watching a far-right conspiracy theorist. \u201cI genuinely thought, \u2018Is this early-onset dementia?\u2019\u201d Eleanor told me. \u201cIt seemed so out of character.\u201d Eleanor\u2019s story of a family member\u2019s surprising, sudden embrace of conspiracy theories echoes countless others that have emerged in recent years, hand in hand with America\u2019s ever more divergent ideological spectrum. The era of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency alone has seen numerous unfounded conspiracy theories enter the mainstream, from increasing numbers of anti-vaxxers fueling measles outbreaks to Pizzagate \u2014 the conspiracy theory that emerged shortly before the 2016 election and alleged that politicians were running a child-trafficking ring \u2014 to numerous Covid-19 hoaxes. There\u2019s no hard evidence that conspiracy theories are circulating more widely today than ever before. But over the past five years, it has certainly seemed like average Americans have bought into them more and more. Surveys within the past year have shown that a quarter of US citizens believe the mainstream media is lying to them about Covid-19, and that it is \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably true\u201d that the outbreak was intentionally planned.  Meanwhile, the headline-grabbing QAnon, a conspiracy theory that evolved from Pizzagate and posits that Trump has been working in secret to capture high-powered figures who are engaged in child abduction and trafficking, is still a niche belief. But a quarter of those who know what it is think there\u2019s at least some truth to it, and that number is growing rapidly as the QAnon theory begins to converge with Covid-19 theories.  As 2020 enters the home stretch, new conspiracy theories seem to keep coming up. The latest? Trump\u2019s baseless claims of voter fraud during the presidential election, which many of his followers are echoing, despite zero evidence, in any state, to support the assertion. \u201cWe\u2019re nine months into the pandemic,\u201d said Ben Radford, a folklorist, psychologist, and fellow with the Center for Inquiry whose research interests include contemporary conspiracies and hoaxes. \u201cSome people are out of a job. There\u2019s lots of uncertainty. And some people will channel that uncertainty into conspiracy theories.\u201d  But how did we get to a place where previously science-minded and logic-loving dads can find conspiracy theories with ease, and where once-fringe paranoia is now embedded in our country\u2019s politics? Why did baseless theories about health, science, and sinister world leadership get to be so popular, and why now?  Let\u2019s walk through the factors leading to the current explosion of conspiracy theories \u2014 and what we can do to combat them.  The history of conspiracy theories is somewhat short, relative to human evolution. According to Radford, the first conspiracy theories as we might recognize them now likely didn\u2019t spring up until the mid-15th century, with the invention of the Gutenberg press in the 1440s. Movable type allowed for the wider spread of information \u2014 and anxious reinterpretation of that information. \u201cSuddenly you not only have knowledge that is reproducible, but you also have other people who are writing about things that may have a different perspective,\u201d Radford said. This was the moment, he argues, in which the first conflicts of information arose over what was true and what wasn\u2019t. Conspiracy theories have most often flourished during times of great sociopolitical upheaval and uncertainty. \u201cYou see this kind of boom in conspiracies whenever there\u2019s political or social unrest throughout history,\u201d Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist who researches conspiracies at the Social Decision-Making Lab at Cambridge, told me. \u201cWhenever there is significant uncertainty in the world.\u201d  Take the Salem witch trials in the 1690s, another transformative moment in conspiratorial thinking. These events were prompted by sweeping social and political changes in Puritan New England: frontier wars with American Indians, expanding roles for women, and challenges to religious authority.  The prevailing fear of Salem witch hunters wasn\u2019t that the woman next door might be a witch, but rather that a vast network of witches existed and were gathering in secret, plotting to do evil. This basic idea of a covert network of evildoers threads through most 20th-century moral panics, from the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories circulated by the Nazis to McCarthyism to the Satanic Panic of the 1980s and \u201990s.  Conspiracy theories provide people with a feeling of control when presented with troubling and disturbing information, calming our fears of the inevitable or unknown. \u201cA lot of these conspiracies detract from some scary themes in the world,\u201d van der Linden told me. \u201cClimate change, coronavirus. It\u2019s just another way to deny reality and having to think about your own fragility in the world. It\u2019s an escape for people who are not so tolerant of uncertainty.\u201d For people who want a sense of order, conspiracy theories may provide a belief framework \u2014 even if it\u2019s a negative one. \u201cIt tells people the world isn\u2019t just random,\u201d Radford said. \u201cThe world\u2019s going to hell, but there is some master plan. People take comfort in that, in a sort of perverse way.\u201d Troubling times further breed conspiracy theories on the principle of supply and demand: The circumstances from which they are born lead to their proliferation. But if conspiracy theories have historically gotten a boost from geopolitical turbulence, modern-day conspiracies have several other unprecedented factors working in their favor \u2014 starting with memes and misinformation. Conspiracy theories are often seen as akin to folklore or urban legends \u2014 as mostly harmless, \u201cwhat if\u201d entertainment. But in the United States, conspiracy theories have much more power than these tales do. The conspiracy theory can be a political weapon, thanks to what historian Richard J. Hofstadter called \u201cthe paranoid style\u201d: a tendency toward hyper-vigilant, alarmist, and absolutist beliefs that stem from a combination of \u201cheated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy.\u201d  This tendency, which Hofstadter thought belonged only to a small minority of people, now undergirds much of American politics. Once-obscure conspiratorial ideas are now habitually deployed by national leaders like Trump and members of his outgoing administration, specifically to create further political tension. \u201cTypically, folklore spreads without much intentional direction,\u201d Radford said. \u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating over the past few months and years is the weaponization of folklore and the weaponization of these sorts of legends in which you have, for example, Russian disinformation agencies.\u201d Social media facilitates the spread of information, giving rise to viral formats like memes. Conspiracy theories are memetic \u2014 they mutate easily and take on new forms \u2014 which makes them a perfect fit for social media platforms.  That\u2019s why blatantly absurd yet longstanding conspiracy tropes \u2014 such as the centuries-old fear that people in power are kidnapping children to drink their blood \u2014 can keep going and going and going: These tropes trigger moral outrage, prompting audiences to spread the story, which then keeps morphing into new forms like stories in a game of Telephone. For example, the \u201cdrinking the blood of children\u201d trope \u2014 used for centuries to justify oppression of Jewish people \u2014 has been applied QAnon\u2019s claim that high-powered Democrats are kidnapping kids to harvest their blood. Such ideas, no matter how far-fetched, can keep spreading indefinitely as they transform and reach vast new audiences.  It\u2019s not just social media that contributes to fearmongering and the spread of misinformation: Many controversial  figures spread conspiracy theories not because they believe in them and want to warn the public, but because they may have other agendas. Alex Jones, the host of the alarmist far-right show Infowars, is perhaps the most successful, visible example of someone building an empire out of peddling conspiracy theories \u2014 the more absurd, the better. But he\u2019s not alone. Conspiracy theories flourish on TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube (which has long fought a battle against those who spread them) not just because individual theories go viral, but because their creators can become hugely influential.  One prominent example is Teal Swan, a new-age vlogger notorious for urging her 750,000 followers toward suicidal ideation. Swan released a video in May that strongly implied that various world governments had facilitated the Covid-19 pandemic to profit from individuals, and that anyone entering quarantine was \u201ca herd animal\u201d being \u201ccontrolled by others.\u201d If you run a Google search on Swan, the results suggest that she is \u201can American teacher,\u201d thus lending her an unearned authority \u2014 a status she shares with many other conspiracy theory gurus.  Another example is Dave Hayes, a Christian writer and YouTuber who\u2019s become a minor leading figure in the QAnon-believers community after he claimed that God explained QAnon to him in a series of prophetic dreams. Hayes and Swan have long built their brands around bizarre ideas; Hayes, for example, promotes a book on his website that he describes as a guide to prophecy and raising the dead. These figures have little to lose by claiming to be authorities on conspiracy theories, and plenty to gain \u2014 from monetized YouTube views to lucrative consulting gigs to sales of books and writings.  This brings us to someone who\u2019s directly profited from the recent spread of conspiracy theories in an atypical way: President Trump. Radford has argued that Trump\u2019s dedication to spreading unfounded or unscientific ideas is a huge reason conspiracy theories have gained such traction over the past decade. \u201cLike him or hate him, Trump has used and benefited from and promoted conspiracy theories in a way that no previous president has,\u201d Radford told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just unprecedented.\u201d Researchers have found that when Trump publicly endorses a belief, his followers become more likely to believe it, regardless of whether it\u2019s factually supported.  Trump has a long history of promoting conspiracy theories, dating from well before his time in politics; in 2007, he claimed that vaccines cause autism. His political career arguably started when he began to spread the false \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama wasn\u2019t born in the US. Conspiracy theories have consistently been key to galvanizing his pious voter base. His supporters\u2019 fears over \u201cillegal votes\u201d currently serve as the foundation for Trump\u2019s attempts to dispute his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden. Eleanor told me she blames Trump specifically for her father\u2019s rapidly evolving distrust of mainstream media, which, like many Trump supporters, he now abbreviates simply as \u201cMSM.\u201d Instead of getting his information from regular media sources, Eleanor said, her father uses Trump\u2019s Twitter feed \u2014 which has been dominated lately by the president\u2019s unfounded claims that the election was a scam \u2014 as his primary news source. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a conversation that you can have\u201d with him, she told me, \u201cand this is where I think Trump is so dangerous. What he\u2019s done to just instill that distrust of the media \u2014 you can\u2019t even say, \u2018Well, here\u2019s an article I read that differs from what you said.\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, like I\u2019m going to believe CNN. Oh, like I\u2019m going to believe the New York Times.\u2019 So it\u2019s all a lie.\u201d Eleanor feels that Trump has emboldened this type of thinking. \u201cBefore, there was maybe a little bit of shame or embarrassment\u201d in believing that social institutions like the media were conspiring against the people, she said. But now, many people seem to proudly indulge in this belief; her father, at Trump\u2019s explicit urging, has claimed that the mainstream media is all part of the big conspiracy.  Eleanor\u2019s reluctance to talk to her father about all of this over fear of the outcome is another factor in the inexorable spread of conspiracy theories: Confronting them with criticism and logic seems to only make them stronger and more difficult to quell. People who adopt the conspiratorial mindset derive three main benefits from doing so. First, there\u2019s an epistemic benefit: Whatever conspiracy theory they believe in provides a framework for understanding the world and bringing order to random events. Second, there\u2019s an existential benefit, in that the conspiracy theory can distract them from facing their fears about sociopolitical upheaval and uncertainty. And third, there\u2019s a social benefit, in that the conspiracy theory provides them with a community of similarly disaffected thinkers who can validate one another\u2019s anxieties and shared worldview. The epistemic benefit is especially important, given the rise in polarization across the ideological spectrum. Vox\u2019s David Roberts has called this trend \u201ctribal epistemology,\u201d in which \u201cinformation is evaluated based not on conformity to common standards of evidence\u201d but on whether your community or \u201ctribe\u201d advocates for it. In this environment, Roberts argues, the primary institutions of society \u2014 government, academia, science, and media, which used to be seen as impartial authorities \u2014 can be rejected if they contradict your tribe\u2019s worldview. A partisan refusal to compromise was once a sign of extremism, but it\u2019s now almost expected, at least in certain tribes. \u201cTruth,\u201d then, is whatever the tribal rhetoric says it is. This cultish approach to information can directly impact how \u201cfacts\u201d are transmitted and received. When people at either end of the political spectrum consider the news media to be biased or corrupt, they\u2019re prone to support even more biased, less objective sources of information. And because those sources tend to embrace conspiracy theories that align with tribal rhetoric, the theories then become difficult to debunk. Conspiracy theorists have what Radford describes as \u201cself-reinforcing belief systems,\u201d which is also part of why the theories spread so quickly \u2014 particularly the political ones. Often, an emotional byproduct of a conspiracy theory is to make the audience feel as though they\u2019ve arrived at a profound new realization about the world on their own. \u201cThey think they\u2019re thinking more critically, when in fact they\u2019re thinking less critically,\u201d van der Linden said.  \u201cThe conspiracy theory provides an access point to people,\u201d Radford told me. \u201cThey think they\u2019re given the key, right? So they\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re woke, and you\u2019re taking the red pill, or blue pill, or whatever the hell pill it is, then you know; you understand what\u2019s going on.\u2019\u201d People who have bought in often believe they can see patterns, codes, and symbols that the rest of us can\u2019t \u2014 a false phenomenon called apophenia, which further validates their beliefs.  For those who are already unorthodox thinkers, the conspiracy theory offers a form of validation. Online, van der Linden observed, \u201cthere\u2019s a whole community out there posting the same thing, validating your beliefs, and you get to chat with people with the same worldview as yours. ... You feel marginalized in society, but now you have a group that you belong to and [are] affiliated with. And it\u2019s a really strong way for people to feel empowered socially, to connect through these conspiracies.\u201d Once someone has accepted one far-fetched conspiracy theory, it often becomes easier to accept others. Even in cases where two conspiracy theories contradict each other, many conspiracy advocates will believe both of them \u2014 because they\u2019ve found an even deeper rationale to explain the inconsistencies. \u201cAnd before you know it,\u201d said van der Linden, \u201cthey\u2019re wrapped up in this worldview where everything is a conspiracy.\u201d Many people who believe in conspiracy theories often don\u2019t just accept the theory as truth \u2014 they allow it to influence their entire life. \u201cWe sometimes refer to [conspiratorial groupthink] as a quasi-religious worldview,\u201d van der Linden told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not religion, because it\u2019s not institutionalized, but it has all the features of extreme religious groups.\u201d   One quasi-religious trait is how conspiracy theories seem to rapidly change the lives and relationships of their advocates. Across the US, families and friendships are increasingly becoming divided over QAnon or similar conspiracy theories. (And lest you think it\u2019s a generational thing, it\u2019s not; kids are falling for it, too.) On Reddit, where QAnon-peddling groups have recently been banned, the subreddits r/QAnonCasualties and r/ReQovery offer spaces for family members to process what\u2019s happened to their loved ones.  In a since-deleted post, one woman wrote about having to escape from her family cabin after her mother and aunts brought her there for a weekend retreat, in what she said turned out to be an attempt to isolate her and reprogram her into accepting QAnon beliefs. Although QAnon is not a religion, the theory\u2019s community acts on its followers in similar ways, leading some to try to convert unbelievers \u2014 or, if failing, to shun them.  \u201cI think my marriage of 13 years is over because of QAnon,\u201d detailed another member who said their partner had succumbed to belief in QAnon. \u201cToday, we began a discussion about [Supreme Court Justice] Amy Coney Barrett and while it started as civil it blew out of proportion so quickly,\u201d another wrote. \u201cMy mom called me \u2018pure evil,\u2019 said I was a demon ... and that all Democrats were killing babies to drink their blood.\u201d  Reddit user graneflatsis, a moderator of QAnonCasualties who\u2019s in their 50s, told me that a few common themes had emerged from the forum that resembled stories of cult-like behavior: stories of QAnon believers displaying mania, as well as signs of sleep deprivation due to so much time spent researching and recruiting for the cause.  \u201cWhoever Q is just kept at it and added more lurid details,\u201d graneflatsis told me. (\u201cQAnon\u201d can refer to the original anonymous 4chan poster, known as \u201cQAnon\u201d or \u201cQ,\u201d whose theories form the basis of QAnon beliefs, or it can refer to the beliefs themselves, i.e., the QAnon conspiracy theory.) \u201cQAnon has the right chemistry, as far as a conspiracy goes,\u201d graneflatsis said. \u201cPizzagate gave QAnon a lot of [momentum] that lasts till today. The narrative that these anons are saving the world is so attractive to folk disenchanted with the way things are.\u201d  As much as conspiracy theories can bring people together, they can also alienate people from larger society. \u201cConspiracies completely disrupt the extent to which people care about other people,\u201d van der Linden told me. Researchers have found, he added, that \u201cone of the negative effects of conspiracy theories is that people are less willing to help others. People are less willing to engage politically, people are less willing to do something about global warming.\u201d At the extreme edges of the conspiratorial belief system, this kind of us-versus-them worldview can engender violence. Graneflatsis told me that while \u201cthere\u2019s a subsection of folk who just like [QAnon] because it gives them some ammo to use against Democrats,\u201d the moderators of QAnonCasualties have had to ban numerous QAnon supporters attempting to recruit members of the community, many using violent rhetoric.  Political scientists and researchers who study extremism have warned that QAnon, in particular, mirrors the wider rise in extremism around the globe and encourages its supporters to act on extremist impulses. Within the past year, QAnon supporters have allegedly engaged in numerous bizarre acts of disruption and crimes, including attempted kidnapping, plotting to assassinate government officials, and committing voter fraud. In 2019, the FBI labeled QAnon a brand of domestic terrorism. But if some conspiracy theories are now being considered forms of violent extremism, that indicates how different today\u2019s conspiracy theories are from the traditional UFO or JFK variety. They seem to be disrupting the lives of more people than ever \u2014 which is why there\u2019s so much clamor about what, if anything, we can do about dismantling them. The knee-jerk tendency most rational-minded people have when confronted with a conspiracy theory that seems absurd to them is to deploy a combination of yelling, dismissiveness, and logic or scientific evidence to talk the conspiracy theorist out of their belief. When all else fails, the rational person may resort to shunning the believer outright.  The problem with these approaches is that they generally make the believer feel defensive, which causes them to double down on their belief systems. That\u2019s not an ideal outcome \u2014 especially considering that, as Radford and van der Linden both stressed to me, many people, when left to their own devices, eventually talk themselves out of a conspiracy theory. They often \u201cwake up\u201d to the discovery that their favorite conspiracy theory is actually more fringe, racist, anti-Semitic, or otherwise dangerous than they realized.  This is where empathy comes in. Radford stressed that conspiracy theories aren\u2019t limited to one side of the political spectrum, and neither is the magical thinking that spawns them. \u201cIf you take a deep dive into any given person\u2019s belief system, you\u2019ll probably find at least a few deeply held beliefs that aren\u2019t based in fact,\u201d he pointed out. Believing in a conspiracy theory doesn\u2019t make someone unintelligent, ignorant, or evil. It just means they\u2019ve encountered bad information \u2014 and these days, bad information is everywhere. Nearly everyone I spoke to while reporting this story had a loved one who\u2019d adopted conspiratorial thinking to some degree. That\u2019s actually how graneflatsis wound up moderating QAnonCasualties. \u201cMy father was brainwashed by Fox News into this really angry guy that would just shout at the TV all day,\u201d they said. Graneflatsis says they eventually talked their dad out of it by applying a cocktail of logic, empathy, and good humor to cut the tension and keep things even-toned and nonthreatening.  One strategy that often works to convince people to rethink their positions on fake news and propaganda, meanwhile, is to discuss the common mechanisms behind the spread of misinformation. A key to recognizing the lie behind a conspiracy, van der Linden says, is to note that the tactics of spreading a conspiracy theory stay the same even if the specifics of the theory change. The use of a false authority figure, the appeal to an individual\u2019s anger and prejudices, and the urgency of the claim \u2014 these are all conspiratorial mainstays. To help spread awareness of such tactics, van der Linden\u2019s research team recently designed and released an online game, Go Viral!, that teaches the player to recognize the factors that help spread fake news. The game was based on research that found that people who are educated to recognize how misinformation spreads are less likely to be duped by it, or to spread it themselves in turn.  That information might be useful for Eleanor, who told me she wanted to speak to me for this story in part as a form of therapy, and in part because she didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cI have one sister and one brother and I\u2019m sure [my dad is] ashamed of the fact that we\u2019re dirty liberals, all three of us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about it at all. This conversation has not been had.\u201d Unfortunately, ignoring conspiracy theories in the hope they\u2019ll go away, or out of fear that acknowledging them will somehow validate them, may be the wrong choice. Left unchallenged, a conspiracy theory can create a shift in people\u2019s views. For example, through his research, van der Linden found that even 30 seconds of exposure to a global warming hoax can make people less willing to sign a petition to take action against climate change. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exposure to a conspiracy among people who don\u2019t believe in conspiracy,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s [not] only the people who are deeply entangled in this for whom this is damaging.\u201d But for those who are exhausted by constant ideological warfare, ignoring fringe beliefs and the people who spout them may just be the easiest option. Van der Linden pointed out that a lot of people, in general, are burned out. Ideally, he said, people would have \u201ca network and trust and support that enables different ideas about the world. But I think the problem is people\u2019s patience has run out. Political hostility is rampant; polarization is too high at the moment to create the conditions that are necessary for that.\u201d Still, he said, an approach of \u201cactively open-minded thinking\u201d is the best path forward that he\u2019s found. \u201cI think at the end of the day, you know, being open-minded will help everyone.\u201d  However, something that van der Linden told me about one of his close family members was both unsettling and revealing. The relative, once a die-hard 9/11 truther, has become less radicalized over time \u2014 not particularly because of any tactics van der Linden deployed, but because he started a family and simply had less time to do conspiracy theory research. And this \u2014 life simply taking its course \u2014 is what Radford tells me may eventually bring an end to the current wave of conspiratorial thinking dominated by QAnon, coronavirus denial, and their ilk. He argued that there\u2019s a \u201cfad aspect\u201d to the current trend \u2014 that conspiracy theories and moral panics have existed for centuries, and while the human tendency to embrace them won\u2019t ever disappear completely, it will diminish in the face of political and economic stability. \u201cA lot of this is rooted in social anxiety about politics, about the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cSooner or later, life will gradually return to normalcy.\u201d   Still, it\u2019s undeniable that we face ongoing battles against misinformation, on subjects from Covid-19 to climate change, from vaccines to votes. The legitimization of conspiracies over the past decade, especially during the Trump administration, has fundamentally altered the way many of us receive and accept information, so that now many people, without any evidence, view scientific method and fact-based journalism as suspicious, and see once-trusted leaders as nefarious plotters. The damage to the public trust has been severe and won\u2019t be easily healed.  And while the idea of a return to normalcy is something many of us long for, it seems foolish to accept, uncritically, that normalcy will come back to save us. If anything, conspiracy theories seem to have shifted American society toward an ever-widening gap between belief and reality \u2014 one in which a consensus on what \u201cnormal\u201d is seems further away than ever."
