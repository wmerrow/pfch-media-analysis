    "article_text": "Trump legal team to probe Mich. Dominion voting machines A Michigan judge approved a probe into potential voting machine fraud in the Great Lake State. The Trump legal team is reviewing Dominion voting machines in Michigan after a state judge issued a decision to allow them to. The order was issued on Friday and it permits forensic photos to be taken from the 22 precinct tabulators in Antrim County. President Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, praised the decision and said that allowing the forensic review is a \u201cbig win for honest elections.\u201d  On Sunday, Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis spoke on the move. She said the team will spend several hours inspecting the machines and gathering data. Local authorities confirmed the machines in question are the same as the ones that were used in the presidential election on November 3. The machines were originally brought into question by a voter who claimed ballots were damaged during a recent recount of a marijuana proposal vote. A similar examination recently occurred in Georgia as President Trump has raised concerns of widespread voter fraud, which rigged the elections.",

As the President grows increasingly frustrated with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, he floats the idea of another Republican lawmaker taking his place. At his Republican National Committee rally on Saturday, the President threw his support behind one of his biggest defenders on Capitol Hill, Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.). President Trump even suggested Collins should run against Kemp for governor. He also praised the congressman\u2019s efforts in his 2020 bid for senator.  \u201cAs you know, he and Kelly had a very strong primary,\u201d President Trump stated. \u201cHe is one of the greatest advocates I\u2019ve ever met in Washington\u2026I wanna thank Doug Collins.\u201d When the President asked Collins whether he would be interested in the position of governor, the crowd cheered loudly. Collins has been serving as an elected official since 2007. The Georgia lawmaker is a staunch supporter of President Trump as he\u2019s backed the President during impeachment attempts from the left. Collins is also an advocate for the second amendment, veterans, religious liberty and he is pro-life. If the Republican is interested in the position, he would likely have to face off with Kemp in a 2022 primary before going up against a Democrat opponent. \u00a0",

On Friday, Judge Nicholas Garaufis handed forward the order, which demands the full reinstatement of DACA, a program aimed at keeping hundreds-of-thousands of undocumented immigrants from deportation. The \u2018Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program\u2018 was created by former President Barack Obama in 2012. It grants work permits to immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, who are known as \u2018dreamers.\u2019 The order reverses a Trump administration memo from July, which sought to prevent widespread abuse of the program. President Trump also sought to create a new constitutional path for immigrants to become U.S. citizens. However, the effort was met with resistance from Democrats who have defended the \u2018DACA\u2019 program, despite widespread abuse by criminals seeking to conduct illegal activity in the U.S. The Trump administration also argued that Obama exceeded his constitutional powers by bypassing Congress when he created DACA. The judge\u2019s order will now require the government to respond to the ruling by Monday. \u00a0",

    "article_text": "President Trump\u2019s legal team claims 40K double votes found in Nev. In addition to other voting irregularities in Nevada, the Trump campaign said that tens-of-thousands of people voted twice. On Thursday, Trump campaign attorney Jesse Binnall told a judge that over 40,000 people voted twice, while 20,000 voters did not have a mailing address and roughly 2,400 voters had an out of state address. The Trump attorney also said a local news station found that 1,500 ballots were cast under dead people\u2019s names. Additionally, Binnall argued that voting machines in Clark County lacked proper security. This information emerged during the Trump legal team\u2019s hearing in front of a state judge on voter fraud.  \u201cThe questions are how did this happen? Who is responsible?\u201d Binnall asked. \u201cAnd what do we do about it?\u201d While addressing the court, Binnall said early policy decisions made by state election officials ultimately set the state up for failure, even months before the election ever took place.  \u201cIt was not an unforeseeable problem,\u201d Binnall added. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem that people were making clear all along. That there was going to be issues if we didn\u2019t take robust efforts in order to make sure that every voter was only voting once.\u201d Binnall specifically highlighted changes to general election procedures that took place before November. These changes removed restrictions on mail-in voter registration. He said that legislators\u2019 decision to adopt AB4 \u201ctook us to a system of universal mail voting at pretty much the last minute.\u201d Back in August, Democrat Governor Steve Sisolak signed AB4 into law in response to the pandemic. He promised a fair and accessible election. Due to the new policy, the number of mail-in ballots cast increased from 6,300 in 2016 to more than 690,000 in 2020. Come Election Day, the wave of mail-in ballots on top of record-high in-person turnout overwhelmed poll-workers. \u201cAs a result, there was a system that was ripe for the picking when it came to fraud,\u201d Binnall claimed. \u201cAnd the fraud came.\u201d Binnall also mentioned that poll workers went on to restrict meaningful access to Republican poll watchers, which made them unable to monitor and ensure the accuracy of the counting process. \u201cElection officials planned and implemented an election system that would be highly susceptible to fraud,\u201d Binnall said. \u201cIt would ignore the best practices developed over the years and skew meaningful observation.\u201d The President\u2019s campaign has argued that the push for election integrity supersedes any political agenda. He stressed that upholding the integrity of American democracy is the primary goal of their legal battle. \u201cTransparency is not political, transparency is something that is necessary for us to have a democratic election,\u201d Binnall emphasized. \u201cSo that we know it is the candidate chosen by the voters that is the one actually elected.\u201d Judge James Russell said he wants to review all of the evidence presented and will make his decision Friday.",

Brian Kemp calls for signature audit In Georgia, Rudy Giuliani heard from witnesses who detailed alleged instances of voter fraud in the battleground state. A video of poll-workers who carried suitcases stuffed with ballots captured the attention of the nation as President Trump\u2019s legal team presented further evidence of voter fraud. On Thursday, the President\u2019s attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis questioned witnesses in the Peach State. Witnesses alleged the election results were undermined by rampant fraud. The Trump campaign posted a video of One America\u2019s coverage of the hearing. The mainstream media chose to ignore the fact-finding session.  Jackie Pick, a lawyer volunteering for the Trump team, presented video evidence of Georgia poll workers at State Farm Arena. The video showed workers reaching under tables and pulling out suitcases stuffed with ballots. Some of them were even forced to evacuate over false alarms of a burst pipe, but Pick provided testimony of what actually happened on Election Day.  \u201cNot everybody left according to plan and some people stayed behind, so this shocked them,\u201d Pick stated. \u201cThey returned to State Farm Arena at about one o\u2019clock in the morning, where they confirmed that in fact, people had just left\u2026 in contradiction with what they were told by those supervising.\u201d One witness noted that not only did 2,506 felons vote illegally, but 66,248 underage individuals did as well. The law requires voters to be 17.5 years old to legitimately vote, but thousands were able to vote before their 17th birthday.\u00a0 He also added that at least two thousand individuals were not listed as registered voters. The examples continued to pile up from there. Notably, Georgia\u2019s current election results show Democrat nominee Joe Biden with just a 13,000 vote lead. In the meantime, protesters gathered outside of the Atlanta Court House \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 event. Thursday\u2019s event showed support for President Trump while casting doubt on the number of votes in favor of Joe Biden.  \u201cI\u2019m out here to support the Stop the Steal movement,\u201d a demonstrator said. \u201cI believe in what President Trump has been doing for the last four years, like I said, this country has prospered.\u201d In an interview Thursday, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp called for more transparency in the state\u2019s election system. He added he believes a signature audit must be carried out for the 2020 elections. The Trump campaign\u2019s legal team is set to continue their fight to ensure free and fair elections. They\u2019ve already traveled to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and now Georiga to present evidence of illegitimate election results.",

While talking to reporters Thursday, the President confirmed he will \u201cabsolutely\u201d sign a deal when he gets a chance. Congress has been at in impasse for months over a stimulus bill and time is quickly running out for lawmakers to pass legislation before the end of the year. Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of legislatures unveiled a $900 billion package in hopes of moving the ball forward. Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer appeared supportive of the bill as a good place to start negotiations. However, Republicans were far more apprehensive of the bill with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy stating he, instead, supports Sen.

    "article_text": "President Trump: GOP senators getting cold feet over ending Section 230 President Trump called out GOP senators who seem to be backing off the fight against Section 230. The President took to Twitter on Thursday to slam the senators and to emphasize that the termination must be put in the Defense Bill.  \u00a0 On Tuesday, President Trump called for the end of Section 230. Section 230 gives companies like Facebook and Twitter the protection of neutral forums rather than publishers.  Critics pointed out these platforms, however, often pick and choose what content they host, which means they act as editors rather than true neutral hosts. President Trump warned if this \u201cdangerous and unfair\u201d law is not completely terminated as part of the \u2018National Defense Authorization Act,\u2019 he would veto the bill. The President has long spoken out against Section 230. Back in May, he signed an executive order to protect the free speech of all Americans.  \u00a0 \u201cMy executive order calls for new regulations, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, to make it so that social media companies that engage in censoring any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield,\u201d President Trump stated. \u201cThey have a shield; they can do what they want. They\u2019re not going to have that shield.\u201d Some senators have called for more discussion over Section 230. They said the Defense Bill isn\u2019t the place to pressure for change. Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany assured the military would get proper funding, but the President is serious about the concerns surrounding the law. \u201cThe President will always defend our military and make sure that we get adequate defense funding as he\u2019s gotten $2.9 trillion so far,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cBut he is going to put the pressure on Congress to step up on this.\u201d On Thursday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy noted the NDAA will get done, but also pointed to the need to do away with Section 230. \u201cWe know that we will get an NDAA done as we\u2019ve done for the last 60 years, but we also know that Section 230\u2026needs to be repealed,\u201d McCarthy stated. \u201cThese technology companies are not acting in the manner of why 230 was created to give them protections that they want to pick and choose what goes on.\u201d McCarthy emphasized that Big Tech doesn\u2019t need the protection any longer. The renewed push to change Section 230 came earlier this year when platforms refused to host a \u2018New York Post\u2018 article, which detailed a hard drive belonging to Hunter Biden. The hard drive linked his business dealings to his father, Joe Biden. In October, the FCC announced it had the legal authority to interpret Section 230 and would move forward with rule-making to clarify its meaning, which was part of the President\u2019s May executive order. \u00a0",

On Wednesday, the White House posted the President\u2019s 45 minute speech on social media in which he detailed multiple instances of voting irregularities. \u201cIn Wisconsin as an example, where we were way up on election night, they ultimately had us miraculously losing by 20,000 votes,\u201d the President explained. \u201cI can show you right here that Wisconsin, we\u2019re leading by a lot and then at 3:42 in the morning there was this, it was a massive dump of votes, mostly Biden.\u201d Given the evidence of a lack of security in the 2020 elections, the President went on to suggest his political opponent is supported by something more sinister. \u201cThe corrupt forces who are registering dead voters and stuffing ballot boxes are the same people who have perpetrated one phony and fraudulent hoax after another,\u201d he stated. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching it now for four years., these entrenched interests oppose our movement because we put America first.\u201d The President has raised concerns Joe Biden seemed to take a backseat in campaigns, while insisting Democrat leaders knew the elections were over before they even began.  President Trump also accused the Democrat establishment of taking advantage of the pandemic by making last minute changes to election procedure. and pushing for universal mail-in-voting. \u2018This colossal expansion of mail-in voting opened the flood gates to massive fraud,\u201d he stated. \u201cIt\u2019s a widely known fact that the voting rolls are packed with people who are not lawfully eligible to vote, including those who are deceased, have moved out of their state and even our non-citizens of our country.\u201d From ineligible voters casting their ballots to cyber attacks, the President said the elections were riddled with voter fraud. He went on to warn similar instances might be seen in Georgia\u2019s January runoffs. This comes as Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are set to defend their seats in a race that is expected to determine which party will control the Senate. President Trump is expected to rally for the Georgia Republicans this weekend while his legal team continues to push for election integrity across the country.",

On Wednesday, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) told One America News that while he\u2019s optimistic the Department of Justice will conduct a thorough review, he\u2019s still a little cynical. President Trump\u2019s campaign continues to maintain that it has evidence of voter fraud in at least six key states despite recent comments by Attorney General William Barr. Biggs also noted shortcomings by the Justice Department, which have prompted concerns about its ability to fulfill its duty. \u201cWe\u2019ve expected the Durham report for a year now\u2026 and we never got it,\u201d Biggs said. \u201cThey\u2019re not out there really busting things to break this thing down to try to resolve some of these issues.\u201d  He added that although we\u2019re seeing more specific allegations, affidavits and evidence, there is still no proof that the attorney general is actively investigating these incidents. Biggs mentioned he hopes the search for evidence of voter fraud continues. He noted that audits would help determine if further remedies are needed. Meanwhile, political consultant Roger Stone also took aim at Barr, calling him \u201cpart of the deep state.\u201d In a video Tuesday, Stone claimed Barr is blocking the nation\u2019s two-tiered justice system. This came after Barr\u2019s remarks, which claim the Justice Department found no substantial voter fraud thus far. Stone went on to cite Barr\u2019s failure to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey as well as former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Additionally, Stone criticized the ongoing \u2018Durham\u2019 probe by calling it a ploy. Stone said there is overwhelming and compelling evidence of voter fraud in the election despite Barr\u2019s claims. \u00a0",

    "article_text": "President Trump praises Operation Warp Speed as Moderna\u2019s vaccine candidate heads into FDA review Lt. Gen. Paul Ostrowski of Operation Warp Speed said 100 percent of Americans will have the opportunity to take a COVID-19 vaccine by June of 2021. He made those remarks Monday while speaking to reporters. However, that\u2019s not the only development on the vaccine front. In a press release the same day, biotech company Moderna said it plans to apply for Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be filing (today) around the world, first regulatory approval for the product for regulators to review it and the FDA has told us an advisory meeting is likely to be meeting on December 17,\u201d stated Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel. \u201cIt is highly possible that between the 17th and Christmas, the product is approved.\u201d It\u2019s the latest candidate to reach that stage following Pfizer and BioNTech, which both have a vaccine already under regulatory review. If Moderna is granted authorization, its vaccine could be available as soon as December 21. In light of the news, President Trump urged the FDA to \u201cact quickly.\u201d He added, \u201cOperation Warp Speed has been a great modern day miracle.\u201d  Moderna has received $1 billion under Operation Warp Speed to fund its vaccine research. The company has also already taken a $1.5 billion order from the U.S. for the pre-manufacturing of 100 million doses of its vaccine, which the company said is 94.1 percent effective and expected to cost about $25 per dose. Moving forward, the vaccine may be approved as soon as Christmas in which case it would likely be distributed to high priority groups first, including frontline medical workers and likely residents of nursing homes.",

    "article_text": "President Trump questions why Ga. governor isn\u2019t doing more against ballot fraud President Trump said all Republicans, especially Georgia Republicans, are angry over officials\u2019 handling of the election in the Peach State. While taking to Twitter Monday, the President questioned why Gov. Brian Kemp (R) will not use his emergency powers to overrule the secretary of state and do a match of signatures on envelopes. He said it would be a \u201cgoldmine\u201d of fraud. The President also called on officials to check the number of envelopes versus ballots, suggesting they won\u2019t match up.  In response, Kemp\u2019s office claimed state law bars him from intervening in elections, noting he\u2019s unable to override the secretary of state by executive order. On Monday, however, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said his office has opened more than 250 cases of voting irregularities and allegations of voter fraud. This came after the Trump campaign requested that Raffensperger order an immediate audit of signatures on absentee ballots and applications received in all counties. Meanwhile, a machine recount is now underway in Georgia with officials expecting the effort to be completed this week.",

    "article_text": "President Trump\u2019s legal team, Ariz. GOP hold hearing on election integrity President Trump\u2019s legal team held a public hearing with Arizona GOP state legislators on election integrity. During Wednesday\u2019s meeting in Phoenix, officials laid out evidence related to electoral compromise and irregularities. Officials confirmed the state used software by Dominion Voting Systems, which attorney Rudy Giuliani called a troubled foreign company with the \u201cmost porous\u201d system of all the automatic voting machine companies.  One poll watcher testified she was certified to witness poll workers study questionable ballots, but was denied access to watch. The purpose of the public hearing was to collect evidence in the 2020 election, which would justify holding a special session for state lawmakers to investigate. Meanwhile, retired Col. Phil Waldron also confirmed voting machines in Arizona used Smartmatic derivative software. He explained it\u2019s a common software being used in the U.S. His testimony indirectly confirms the claims of potential Venezuelan and Iranian meddling in the election, which went through Scytl servers in Europe.  Waldron\u2019s testimony confirmed foreign meddling was helping Joe Biden and switching votes away from President Trump. Attorney Sidney Powell said the Scytl server has since been seized and secure by who she called \u201cthe good guys.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Trump admin. proposes new rule to protect the fossil fuel industry from discriminatory banks The Trump administration is looking to implement a new rule through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to keep banks from discriminating against fossil fuel companies by way of denying them finances. This comes after an October decision where five of the six largest banks in the U.S. pledged to end financing for oil companies who look to drill in the Arctic. These banks include Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. The most push-back over the banks\u2019 decision came from Republicans in states with large energy industries, while the loudest praise came from environmentalist groups and authors like 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben. Banks are not the only ones taking an activist position on the issue. Investment groups like BlackRock are also picking and choosing whom to give loans on what many Republicans believe is a discriminatory basis. However, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink claims his company is only spending money where their investors want it to go, which he said is environmental action. \u201cWe are responding to our client\u2019s wishes, where they want their money to be placed,\u201d he stated. This proposal by the Trump administration ultimately takes the ability to be activists away from banks who, by denying funds to fossil fuel companies, are ultimately using their wealth and influence to direct U.S. energy policy even though the public never elected them to make those decisions. What many Republicans believe this new rule will do is keep private banks from discriminating against completely law abiding companies and, perhaps, take away the ability for banks to become activists who only invest in industries or companies they agree with. Ultimately, this even relieves pressure on the private citizen whose only issue to consider when doing business with a bank is if it\u2019s a good financial decision for themselves and not what political issues that bank chooses to support.",

    "article_text": "N.C. protesters show support for President Trump, disdain for COVID-19 restrictions Passion was running high in Raleigh, North Carolina over the weekend when protesters on both sides of the aisles engaged in civil discourse. On Sunday, supporters of President Trump took to the streets outside the North Carolina Governor\u2019s Mansion to protest Democrat Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. Cooper recently rolled out a series of social distancing measures, including a face mask mandate and restricting social gatherings to under 10 people. \u201cI am here today to tell Roy Cooper that he does not control me, I am a free American citizen and that I will have as many people in my household as I please,\u201d said Ashley Smith, a ReOpenNC protester. \u201cAnd he cannot enforce any of his non-sensible dictates in my life.\u201d  This came a day after hundreds of demonstrators held a rally to show their support for President Trump and his fight for election integrity. Counter protesters crashed the rally, showing support for Joe Biden and the Black Lives Matter movement. Both sides got into verbal arguments over several issues, including police violence, coronavirus and the election results. No one was hurt in either event as local police officers ensured the dueling protests were conducted safely. \u201cI believe that Donald Trump did win this election by a landslide,\u201d said David Jeremy, a MAGA protester\u00a0 in Raleigh. \u201cIt will be proven when the fake ballots, the bought ballots and all that\u2026when it\u2019s all revealed.\u201d North Carolina showed their support for the President on Election Day by giving him the popular vote as well as 15 electoral votes.",
