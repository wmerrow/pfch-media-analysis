    "article_text": "Barr Is Said to Be Weighing Whether to Leave Before Trump\u2019s Term Ends WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General William P. Barr is considering stepping down before President Trump\u2019s term ends next month, according to three people familiar with this thinking. One said Mr. Barr could announce his departure before the end of the year. It was not clear whether the attorney general\u2019s deliberations were influenced by Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to concede his election loss or his fury over Mr. Barr\u2019s acknowledgment last week that the Justice Department uncovered no widespread voting fraud. In the ensuing days, the president refused to say whether he still had confidence in his attorney general. One of the people insisted that Mr. Barr had been weighing his departure since before last week and that Mr. Trump had not affected the attorney general\u2019s thinking. Another said Mr. Barr had concluded that he had completed the work that he set out to accomplish at the Justice Department. But the president\u2019s public complaints about the election, including a baseless allegation earlier last week that federal law enforcement had rigged the election against him, are certain to cast a cloud over any early departure by Mr. Barr. By leaving early, Mr. Barr could avoid a confrontation with the president over his refusal to advance Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to rewrite the election results. Mr. Barr\u2019s departure would also deprive the president of a cabinet officer who has wielded the power of the Justice Department more deeply in service of a president\u2019s political agenda than any attorney general in a half-century. Conversely, it would please some Trump allies, who have called for Mr. Barr to step down over his refusal to wade further into Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election outcome. Mr. Barr has not made a final decision, and the prospect of him staying on through Jan. 20 remains a possibility, the people familiar with his thinking cautioned. Should Mr. Barr step down before the end of the Trump administration, the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, would be expected to lead the Justice Department until President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is sworn in. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. The White House had no comment. Mr. Barr, 70, is the strongest proponent of presidential power to hold the office of attorney general since Watergate. Soon after he was confirmed in February 2019, he gained Mr. Trump\u2019s trust and his ear. He managed to heal fissures between the White House and the Justice Department that broke open when the president learned that his campaign was under investigation related to Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Barr believed that the F.B.I. had abused its power in investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. An independent inspector general has found that the bureau had sufficient reason to open the inquiry and that senior officials there acted without political bias in doing so. But weeks after taking office, Mr. Barr released a summary of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that a judge later called distorted and misleading. He presented it in the best possible light for Mr. Trump before the public could read it. Mr. Barr soon asked John H. Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to open an investigation into the Russia inquiry itself to seek out any wrongdoing under the Obama administration. While that investigation has not yet produced the kind of results that Mr. Trump has explicitly said he would like to see \u2014 including criminal charges against former President Barack Obama and Mr. Biden, as well as the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey \u2014 Mr. Barr has ensured that Mr. Durham\u2019s work will continue into the next administration. In October, he secretly appointed Mr. Durham a special counsel assigned to seek out any wrongdoing in the course of the Russia investigation. Mr. Barr revealed that appointment last week at the same time that he said he had not seen evidence that voter fraud had affected the results of the election. Pairing the Durham announcement with that revelation was widely seen as an effort to placate Mr. Trump, who was said to be enraged that Mr. Barr had publicly contradicted him. Throughout the presidential campaign, Mr. Barr was among the loudest voices warning that mail-in ballots would result in mass election fraud. He routinely claimed in speeches and interviews that the potential for widespread voter fraud was high and posed a grave danger. Mr. Barr\u2019s claims were sometimes false or exaggerated and were widely refuted. \u201cI don\u2019t have empirical evidence other than the fact that we\u2019ve always had voting fraud. And there always will be people who attempt to do that,\u201d Mr. Barr said in September. He called his conclusions \u201ccommon sense.\u201d And after the election, Mr. Barr opened the door to politically charged election fraud investigations, authorizing federal prosecutors to investigate \u201cspecific allegations\u201d of voter fraud before results were certified. Typically, the Justice Department waits until after vote totals are certified to investigate such suspicions in order to avoid shaking public confidence in elections. At the same time, Mr. Barr\u2019s public appearances dwindled, and he did not comment on the results or Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the outcome. But as the president\u2019s legal challenges hit a dead end, the pressure on Mr. Barr to speak out increased when Mr. Trump suggested in an interview on Nov. 29 that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. might have been \u201cinvolved\u201d in some sort of election fraud. \u201cThis is total fraud. And how the F.B.I. and Department of Justice \u2014 I don\u2019t know, maybe they\u2019re involved \u2014 but how people are allowed to get away with this stuff is unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Trump told the Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. Mr. Barr broke his silence a few days later, telling The Associated Press that he had not seen evidence of election fraud on a scale that would have changed the fact that Mr. Biden won. \u201cTo date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,\u201d he said. With Mr. Barr\u2019s departure, Mr. Trump would lose the cabinet official who has carried out his agenda on policing, racial unrest, affirmative action and immigration. Unlike officials who have privately denigrated Mr. Trump, department officials and friends say that Mr. Barr agrees with most, if not all, of the president\u2019s positions, as well as his view that he was wronged by the Obama administration. Mr. Barr himself has taken umbrage at the notion that his actions that helped Mr. Trump\u2019s allies \u2014 reducing a sentencing recommendation for the president\u2019s longtime friend Roger J. Stone Jr. on seven felony convictions and seeking to withdraw the prosecution of Michael T. Flynn on a charge of lying to investigators \u2014 were done at the president\u2019s behest. He has publicly and privately insisted that he would have made those moves no matter what because he felt they were right. When Mr. Barr left the Justice Department in 1993 after serving as attorney general under President George Bush, he became the general counsel of the telecommunications company GTE Corp., which eventually became Verizon. That stint at the company ended with a $10.4 million payout and made him a millionaire many times over, making it unlikely that he will take another full-time job after he leaves the department.",

    "article_text": "In Georgia Debate, Kelly Loeffler Won\u2019t Say Trump Lost ATLANTA \u2014 In a televised debate on Sunday night, Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Georgia Republican, declined to say that President Trump had lost the election, arguing instead that the president had \u201cevery legal recourse available\u201d to pursue his baseless assertion that the vote in Georgia was rigged against him. Ms. Loeffler, whose runoff race is one of two in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate on Jan. 5, has emerged as a staunch defender of Mr. Trump. She used the debate to label her Democratic opponent, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, as a \u201cradical liberal\u201d more than a dozen times over the course of an hour. Mr. Warnock criticized Ms. Loeffler, one of the richest members of the Senate, for making a large number of stock trades after she attended a briefing on the coronavirus in January. Ms. Loeffler did not answer directly when asked whether members of Congress should be barred from trading stocks. \u201cLook, what\u2019s at stake here in this election is the American dream,\u201d Ms. Loeffler said, calling the question of her stock trades \u201ca left-wing media lie.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is an attack on every single Georgian who gets up every day to work hard to provide a better life for their family.\u201d Ms. Loeffler\u2019s trades and those of two other senators were investigated by the Justice Department, but the department announced in May that it would not pursue insider trading charges against them. A Senate Ethics Committee investigation also found no evidence of violations. The debate came one day after Mr. Trump held a rally in Georgia in which he falsely claimed that he had won the state \u2014 and after he made a phone call to Gov. Brian Kemp, asking him to call a special session of the Republican-controlled legislature so that lawmakers could appoint new electors who would subvert the will of the state\u2019s voters when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 14. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Kemp and Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, both Republicans, said that a special session would not be called in Georgia, reiterating a position they had taken previously. \u201cDoing this in order to select a separate slate of presidential electors is not an option that is allowed under state or federal law,\u201d they said. Mr. Kemp and Mr. Duncan added that state law allows the legislature only to \u201cdirect an alternative method for choosing presidential electors if the election was not able to be held on the date set by federal law.\u201d Ms. Loeffler and Georgia\u2019s other Republican senator, David Perdue, have both stuck by the president, attending the rally with him in Valdosta, Ga., on Saturday. But prominent Republicans are worried that Mr. Trump\u2019s airing of his grievances about his loss in the state might convince his supporters that Georgia\u2019s voting system is indeed rigged and that they should sit out the crucially important runoff elections. Losses by both Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue would hand control of the Senate to the Democrats. At the debate, Ms. Loeffler hammered repeatedly on her theme that Mr. Warnock \u2014 the pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached \u2014 was dangerously out of step with Georgia values. She said that he had criticized the police from the pulpit and advocated \u201csocialism\u201d and abortion rights. Mr. Warnock also portrayed Ms. Loeffler as being out of touch, bringing up her stock trades and criticizing her initial opposition to Congress\u2019s relief package for people and businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. (Ms. Loeffler eventually voted for the $2 trillion package in March.) Mr. Warnock also sought to make the case, late in the debate, that Ms. Loeffler was a radical in her own right, noting that she \u201cwelcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist,\u201d a likely reference to Representative-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has espoused the movement\u2019s pro-Trump conspiracy theories in the past. The debate came at the end of a day made particularly tense by Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion, at his Saturday night rally, that the presidential election had been \u201crigged\u201d in Georgia, a state that two recounts have shown he lost. The latest tally has Joseph R. Biden Jr. winning by about 12,000 votes. Georgia has already seen remarkable Republican infighting over Mr. Trump\u2019s push to reverse the results of the race. Violent threats against elections workers have grown so problematic that a top state elections official, Gabriel Sterling, a Republican, last week asked the president to check his inflammatory language. On Sunday morning, high-ranking Georgia officials from Mr. Trump\u2019s own party pushed back, yet again, against the president\u2019s bogus assertions of widespread electoral fraud. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who has become one of the chief targets of Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath in recent days, went on the ABC program \u201cThis Week\u201d and addressed the president\u2019s phone call to Mr. Kemp. Mr. Raffensperger, who, like Mr. Kemp, supported Mr. Trump in the election, said that holding a special session would amount to \u201cnullifying the will of the people.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day, the voice of the people were spoken,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed as a conservative Republican also.\u201d The other runoff race in Georgia pits Mr. Perdue, a former corporate executive, against Jon Ossoff, a 33-year-old Democrat and documentary filmmaker. Mr. Perdue declined to attend a debate with Mr. Ossoff on Sunday, which resulted in a strange 30-minute session in which Mr. Ossoff faced off against an empty lectern. Mr. Ossoff called Mr. Perdue a \u201ccoward\u201d for not debating and criticized what he described as the senator\u2019s early understatement of the threat posed by the coronavirus. \u201cThe reason that we are losing thousands of people per day to this virus is because of the arrogance of politicians like David Perdue,\u201d Mr. Ossoff said. \u201cSo arrogant that he disregarded public health expertise, and so arrogant that he\u2019s not with us here today to answer questions.\u201d He added, \u201cHe believes the Senate seat belongs to him.\u201d Standing alone on the debate stage, Mr. Ossoff took aim, as he has in the past, at Mr. Perdue\u2019s own controversial stock trades, which prompted Mr. Ossoff in a previous debate to call Mr. Perdue a \u201ccrook.\u201d The New York Times has reported that the Justice Department investigated but declined to charge Mr. Perdue for possible insider trading over his sale of more than $1 million worth of stock in a financial-analysis firm. The Times and other outlets have also documented numerous instances in which Mr. Perdue traded stocks in companies that stood to benefit from policies before committees and subcommittees on which he serves. \u201cHis blatant abuse of his power and privilege to enrich himself is disgraceful,\u201d Mr. Ossoff said. Mr. Perdue has previously said he has done nothing wrong. At one point in Ms. Loeffler\u2019s debate with Mr. Warnock, she asked him about his arrest in 2002 for obstructing law enforcement officials who were conducting a child abuse investigation at a summer camp in Maryland that was affiliated with Mr. Warnock\u2019s church at the time. Mr. Warnock responded that he was \u201cworking at trying to make sure that young people, who were being questioned by law enforcement, had the benefit of counsel, a lawyer or a parent.\u201d He added, \u201cThe law enforcement officers actually later thanked me for my cooperation and for helping them.\u201d The website PolitiFact and others have noted that the charges were dismissed by a judge after a prosecutor said there had been a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d with Mr. Warnock, who had been \u201cvery helpful\u201d with the investigation. Mr. Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia was a remarkable upset for Democrats in a state that has been reliably Republican for years. The result sent a shock wave through the state\u2019s conservative establishment. Last week, a group of prominent Georgia Republicans, including former Gov. Nathan Deal, released an open letter arguing that Republicans need to heal their divisions, unify their party and focus on the runoffs if they are to maintain control of the Senate. Mr. Trump\u2019s war with Georgia\u2019s Republican leadership over the state\u2019s election results continues to put Republicans who oversaw the election in the position of defending the integrity of the voting system. \u201cThe president\u2019s statements are false,\u201d Mr. Sterling, the elections official, said in an appearance on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThey are misinformation. They are stoking anger and fear among his supporters \u2014 and hell, I voted for him.\u201d Mr. Trump has raised a flurry of claims to try to undermine the results, railing against vote-counting machines and falsely asserting that mail-in ballots are rife with fraud. Mr. Sterling gained widespread attention last week for directly calling out Mr. Trump at an emotional news conference, during which he condemned the spread of spurious claims surrounding the election and the silence of Republicans who were refusing to challenge it. On Sunday, Mr. Sterling reiterated his outrage and his disappointment, particularly in Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler, who for the most part have stood by Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican,\u201d Mr. Sterling said. \u201cWe need to hold on to the Senate, so I\u2019m still going to vote for them. But I\u2019m not happy with how they\u2019ve conducted themselves in this particular situation.\u201d Richard Fausset reported from Atlanta, and Rick Rojas from Nashville.",

    "article_text": "Giuliani has tested positive for the coronavirus, Trump says. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and President Trump\u2019s personal and campaign lawyer, has tested positive for the coronavirus, Mr. Trump announced on Twitter on Sunday. Mr. Giuliani has been admitted to Georgetown University Medical Center, according to a person who was aware of his condition but not authorized to speak publicly. Mr. Giuliani, at age 76, is in the high-risk category for the virus. Later Sunday, he wrote on Twitter: \u201cThank you to all my friends and followers for all the prayers and kind wishes. I\u2019m getting great care and feeling good. Recovering quickly and keeping up with everything.\u201d His son, Andrew H. Giuliani, a White House adviser, said on Nov. 20 he had tested positive for the virus. He had appeared at a news conference with his father the day before. Mr. Giuliani has been acting as the lead lawyer for Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to overthrow the results of the election. He has repeatedly claimed he has evidence of widespread fraud, but he has declined to submit that evidence in legal cases he has filed. \u201c@RudyGiuliani, by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, and who has been working tirelessly exposing the most corrupt election (by far!) in the history of the USA, has tested positive for the China Virus. Get better soon Rudy, we will carry on!!!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. It was unclear why Mr. Trump was the one announcing it. Mr. Giuliani recently traveled to three battleground states that Mr. Biden won to make his case. On Thursday he attended a hearing at the Georgia Capitol, where he didn\u2019t wear a mask. He also went maskless on Wednesday at a legislative session in Michigan, where he lobbied Republicans to overturn the results of the election there and appoint a slate of electors for Trump. \u201cMayor Giuliani tested negative twice immediately preceding his trip to Arizona, Michigan, and Georgia,\u201d the Trump campaign said. \u201cThe Mayor did not experience any symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 until more than 48 hours after his return.\u201d However, a person in contact with the former mayor said he began feeling ill late this past week. Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly been exposed to the virus through contact with infected people, including during Mr. Trump\u2019s preparation for his first debate against President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. in September, just before the president tested positive. His infection is the latest in a string of outbreaks among those in the president\u2019s orbit. Boris Epshteyn, a member of the Trump campaign legal team, tested positive late last month. The same day, Mr. Giuliani attended a meeting of Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania about allegations of voting irregularities. One of the lawmakers at that meeting was notified shortly after, while at the White House, that he had tested positive. Mark Meadows, the president\u2019s chief of staff, and at least eight others in the White House and Mr. Trump\u2019s circle, tested positive in the days before and after Election Day. Mr. Trump was hospitalized on Oct. 2 after contracting the coronavirus. Kayleigh McEnany, the president\u2019s press secretary, Corey Lewandowski, a campaign adviser, and Ben Carson, the housing secretary, are among those in the president\u2019s circle who have tested positive this fall. Mr. Giuliani appeared on Fox News earlier on Sunday. Speaking with the host Maria Bartiromo via satellite, Mr. Giuliani repeated baseless claims about fraud in Georgia and Wisconsin on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d When asked if he believed Mr. Trump still had a path to victory, he said, \u201cWe do.\u201d Melina Delkic and Bryan Pietsch contributed reporting.  After a small White House outbreak in September and a wave of cases in early October, the coronavirus has returned to the top of the Trump administration.",

    "article_text": "Why Do So Many Americans Think the Election Was Stolen? There have been few surprises this past month in how Donald Trump has dealt with the reality of his electoral defeat. Anyone familiar with his career could have predicted that he would claim to have been cheated out of victory. Anyone watching how he wielded power (or, more often, didn\u2019t) as president could have predicted that his efforts to challenge the election results would be embarrassing, ridiculous and dismissed with prejudice in court. And anyone watching how the Republican Party dealt with his ascent could have predicted that its leaders would mostly avoid directly rebuking him, relying instead on the inertial forces of American democracy, the conscientiousness of judges and local officialdom, and Trump\u2019s own incompetence to turn back his final power grab. So far, so predictable. But speaking as a cynical observer of the Trump era, one feature of November did crack my jaded shell a bit: not his behavior or the system\u2019s response, but the sheer scale of the belief among conservatives that the election was really stolen, measured not just in polling data but in conversations and arguments, online and in person, with people I would not have expected to embrace it. The potency of this belief has already scrambled some of the conventional explanations for conspiratorial beliefs, particularly the conceit that the key problem is misinformation spreading downward from partisan news outlets and social-media fraudsters to the easily deceived. As I watch the way certain fraud theories spread online, or watch conservatives abandon Fox News for Newsmax in search of validating narratives, it\u2019s clear that this is about demand as much as supply. A strong belief spurs people to go out in search of evidence, a lot of so-called disinformation is collected and circulated sincerely rather than cynically, and the power of various authorities \u2014 Tucker Carlson\u2019s show or Facebook\u2019s algorithm \u2014 to change beliefs is relatively limited. But what has struck me, especially, is how the belief in a stolen election has spread among people I wouldn\u2019t have thought of as particularly Trumpy or super-partisan, who aren\u2019t cable news junkies or intensely online, who didn\u2019t even seem that invested in the election before it happened. Others have taken note of the same phenomenon: At National Review, Michael Brendan Dougherty writes that \u201cfriends who I did not know were political are sending me little snippets of allegations of voter fraud and manipulation.\u201d At The American Mind, the pseudonymous Californian Peachy Keenan describes watching a passel of lukewarm Trump-supporter moms in her Catholic parish suddenly \u201cget MAGAfied\u201d by election conspiracy theories. (As a fraud believer herself, she thinks that\u2019s a good thing.) Drawn from my conversations in the past few weeks, here\u2019s an attempt at a taxonomy of these unlikely seeming fraud believers. I say \u201cnormie\u201d to reflect the reality that being open to the possibility of conspiracies is itself extremely normal and commonplace. There is nothing unusual, statistically speaking, about believing that a Cold War-era deep state assassinated John F. Kennedy or that the government is concealing evidence of U.F.O.s. Conspiracy theories are common among Democrats as well as Republicans: Witness the polling on Russia\u2019s supposed tampering with vote totals in 2016 or George W. Bush\u2019s supposed foreknowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks; recall the voting-machine theory spun to explain John Kerry\u2019s narrow defeat in 2004. This means you don\u2019t need a complex story about Facebook or Fox News to understand why a person who isn\u2019t intensely political might nonetheless be open to the idea that an election settled by tens of thousands of votes in a few key states was actually fixed for the winner. That kind of openness is just human nature \u2014 and not the worst part of human nature, either, given that conspiracies and cover-ups exist (the military really has been hiding weird evidence of U.F.O.s!) and even wrongheaded theories often partake of a reasonable skepticism about elite malfeasance, from the Gulf of Tonkin era to the Jeffrey Epstein case. What\u2019s happened in the past month with our open-minded normie, though, is that this openness has been validated by the president of the United States and his retainers in a way that other forms of conspiracy curiosity are not. There is a longstanding pattern in both political parties of gently encouraging conspiracizing. (The Diebold-stole-Ohio theories in 2004 were given oxygen by prominent congressional Democrats; MSNBC\u2019s Russiagate coverage was not exactly cautious in the theories that it entertained.) But Trump is obviously different \u2014 higher-profile and more radical. He\u2019s a president, not a cable-TV host or a congressman, and he\u2019s shouting allegations, any allegations, with no pussyfooting, hedging or deniability involved. If you are biased against conspiracy theories, this shouting is ridiculous. If you\u2019re somewhat open toward them, though, and somewhat right-of-center, it provides encouragement. It\u2019s not that the curious normie listens to Trump and thinks that everything he says is true. It\u2019s that Trump is providing validation for the belief that something might be true, that where there are so many claims of fraud a few might be accurate, that where there\u2019s so much smoke there might be a blaze or two as well. Of course there are also lots of pure Trump loyalists who trust his claims absolutely, and a certain number of QAnon-type fantasists who embrace any theory no matter how baroque. But the voter-fraud narrative is pervasive on the right because you don\u2019t have to be a loyalist or a fantasist to take something from Trump\u2019s rants \u2014 not belief itself, but the permission to believe. The next category of believer consists of extremely smart people whose self-identification is bound up in constantly questioning and doubting official forms of knowledge. Conservatism has always had plenty of this sort in its ranks, but the consolidated progressive orthodoxy in elite institutions means that more and more people come to conservative ideas because they seem like a secret knowledge, an account of the world that\u2019s compelling and yet excluded from official discourse. This, in turn, instills a perpetual suspicion about anything that seems to have too much of a liberal consensus defending it, especially any idea that gets mocked and laughed at more than it gets rebutted. And it creates a strong epistemological bias toward what you can only find out for yourself, as opposed to what Yale\u2019s experts or Twitter\u2019s warning labels or The New York Times might tell you. In many cases the outsider-intellectual\u2019s approach generates real insight. (Anonymous right-wing Twitter was way out ahead of the coronavirus threat, for instance, at a time when official liberalism was still fretting more about xenophobia than the virus itself.) But it also tends to recapitulate the closed-circle problems of the official knowledge it rejects. Thus the outsider-intellectual type looks at the no-voter-fraud consensus and immediately goes out in search of cracks in the pillar of official truth, anomalies that official certainty elides. A lot of the supposed evidence of fraud that circulates online comes from these efforts \u2014 not from grifts or lies (though grifters and liars do pick them up) but from sincere analyses of election data, which inevitably turn up anomalies here and there, which confirm the searchers\u2019 assumptions, which closes the circle and convinces them that the official narrative is false and voter fraud is real. This final camp includes many of the people reading and circulating the outsider-intellectual analyses \u2014 people on the right whose perceptions of what liberal institutions and actors are capable of doing have been altered by the coronavirus era. Many liberals have spent the Trump years worried about a kind of Reichstag Fire moment, a crisis that Trump might use as an excuse to consolidate authoritarianism. But a lot of conservatives experienced May and June of the Covid era as a mirror image of those anti-Trump fears \u2014 as a crisis that seemed to be deliberately exploited for revolutionary purposes by politicians and activists of the left. Their story of the spring and early summer starts with our country\u2019s leaders and experts calling for unprecedented sacrifice, with lockdowns and closures that disproportionately affected small businesses, churches and families with children \u2014 all conservative-coded groups and institutions \u2014 while liberal professionals on Zoom were in better shape and the great powers of Silicon Valley expanded their influence and wealth. Then, based on a single activist-amplified case of police brutality, the same experts and politicians suddenly abandoned restrictions for the sake of left-wing protests \u2026 which the official media pretended were peaceful even when they cut a violent swathe through American cities \u2026 which included a wave of iconoclasm against key symbols of American history \u2026 even as a new ideological vocabulary seemed to suddenly take over elite institutions \u2026 and dissenting figures were purged \u2026 and in the background the world\u2019s elites loudly announced that they were seeking a \u201cGreat Reset,\u201d a post-coronavirus new world order. For the radicalized, all this felt stage-managed, prearranged \u2014 both as a further escalation in the establishment\u2019s battle against Trump, a successor to the Mueller investigation and the impeachment push, and as an attempt to use the weirdness of the Covid situation to consolidate radical power within elite institutions. Experiencing and interpreting the summer of 2020 this way primed people to expect further escalation in the fall: After all, if liberals exploited a pandemic to stage-manage an ideological revolution, why wouldn\u2019t they exploit all the weird features of pandemic voting to stage-manage the election outcome? No doubt some of my liberal readers will find this question too ridiculous to even merit an answer. You can\u2019t argue someone out of a conspiracy theory, a common axiom goes, which means the only appropriate response to these ideas is condemnation and a kind of quarantine \u2014 to be achieved, presumably, through better Facebook algorithms, the comprehensive political defeat of the Republican Party and some sort of \u201chave you no sense of decency, sir\u201d courage from news anchors and political leaders whenever right-wing paranoia re-emerges. I don\u2019t see any way that these efforts will work. (Certainly on the evidence of 2020, the Republican Party isn\u2019t going anywhere, let alone about to be \u201cburned to the ground\u201d as some anti-Trumpers hoped.) Of course the alternative \u2014 actually trying to argue with people in the camps I\u2019ve just described \u2014 may not work either, especially given the curated virtual realities that the internet increasingly enables us all to inhabit. But I\u2019ve been argued in and out of a few outr\u00e9 theories in my life. (Only the best outr\u00e9 theories, I assure you.) And if you accept that there\u2019s more reasoning involved in conspiracy theorizing than official wisdom suggests, then once such theories achieve a certain prominence, there\u2019s an obligation to actually make the case against them rather than just laugh them away. My own attempts at argument have run as follows: To the conspiracy-curious Republican whose curiosity is validated by Trump\u2019s allegations of fraud, I\u2019ve suggested that the place to look for fire amid the smoke is in claims that the president\u2019s lawyers are actually willing to advance in court, as opposed to in news conferences, semiofficial hearings and on Twitter. Those lawyers \u2014 especially now that it\u2019s mostly just the Rudy Giuliani show \u2014 have every incentive to blow a fraud case wide open. If their legal claims don\u2019t actually allege fraud or they fall apart under scrutiny, then so should your assumption that the president\u2019s blustering must have some real-world correlative. To the outsider-intellectuals fascinated by anomalies in ballot counts or ballot return patterns, I\u2019ve argued that anomalies indicating fraud would have to show up in the final vote totals \u2014 meaning some pattern of results in key swing-state cities that differ starkly from the results in cities in less-contested states, or some turnout pattern in a swing state\u2019s suburbs that looks weird relative to the suburbs in a deep- blue or deep-red state. But where claims for those kinds of anomalies have been offered, they\u2019ve turned out to be false. So until a compelling example can be cited, anomalies in the counting process should be presumed to be error or randomness, not fraud. Finally to the radicalized, I\u2019ve tried to convey, based on my own knowledge of how liberal institutions work, that what looked stage-managed to outsiders in the May and June disturbances actually reflected organic upheaval and division, sincere antiracism and disorganized Trump-phobia, a crisis in the mind of liberalism, a dose of religious revival, plus a chaotic revolt by city-dwellers against a lockdown experience that fell heavily on them. Hypocrisy and radicalism alike there was in plenty, but literally nobody was in charge, except sometimes for activists in the younger generation who sensed a professional opportunity, and any supposed \u201cplan\u201d or \u201creset\u201d was just a hapless attempt by elder statesmen to get woke. Put more succinctly: The liberal establishment that I watched stagger through May and June could not plan a sweeping voter-fraud conspiracy to save its life. Have I persuaded anyone with these arguments? Maybe not, and as a columnist for a noted establishment organ, I\u2019m probably not the best person to make them anyway. That distinction belongs to people more enmeshed in the conservative universe, scribes for National Review and talk-radio hosts and conservative media critics, all of whom are the more important arguers for an intra-Republican debate. But I am certain that these issues are connected to a larger and more important question for the future of the right. At the moment, the voter-fraud narrative is being deployed, often by people more cynical than the groups I\u2019ve just described, to help an outgoing president \u2014 one who twice lost the popular vote and displayed gross incompetence in the face of his administration\u2019s greatest challenge \u2014 stake a permanent claim to the leadership of his party and establish himself as the presumptive Republican nominee in 2024. And it\u2019s being used to push aside the more compelling narrative that the Republican Party could take away from 2020, which is that Trump\u2019s presidency demonstrated that populism can provide a foundation for conservatism, but to build on it the right needs a very different leader than the man Joe Biden just defeated. That\u2019s the most important argument for the next four years \u2014 and one I\u2019ll be making firmly, passionately, right up until the Republican Party nominates Trump again in 2024.

    "article_text": "\u2018S.N.L.\u2019 Parodies Rudy Giuliani and Melissa Carone\u2019s Disastrous Hearing The emergence of a new public figure in the political sphere is a precious moment for fans of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d one that often sets off a guessing game of which cast member (or, lately, which celebrity guest star) will be playing that person by the weekend. Who would make the best Brett Kavanaugh? The perfect Robert Mueller? The ideal Dr. Anthony Fauci? So last week at a Michigan House hearing, after Rudy Giuliani helped introduce audiences to Melissa Carone, a contractor for Dominion Voting Systems with an assertive confidence in her unverified claims of voter fraud that a Wayne County judge had already described as \u201csimply not credible,\u201d viewers of \u201cS.N.L.\u201d went into action. In particular, the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d faithful couldn\u2019t help but draw comparisons between Carone\u2019s distinctive cadence and the speech patterns of the Girl You Wish You Hadn\u2019t Started a Conversation With at a Party, the recurring character played by Cecily Strong. And sure enough, Strong took center stage in this weekend\u2019s opening sketch, playing Carone in a parody of the Michigan hearing. The sketch also featured Kate McKinnon as an audibly flatulent Giuliani, who told the legislators that he and President Trump planned to keep contesting election results: \u201cFirst in Michigan, then in Georgylvania, and then Pennsachusetts and then North Dacanada,\u201d she said. McKinnon added that she would introduce \u201ca dozen highly intelligent, barely intoxicated individuals who are all eyewitnesses.\u201d That parade began with Strong, as Carone, who emphatically told the House members: \u201cExcuse me, maybe try losing the attitude first. Just like you lost all those Trump ballots.\u201d More witnesses testified, including Heidi Gardner as a woman who said she ate ballots; Beck Bennett as the My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell; Alex Moffat as the victim of an alien abduction; and Chloe Fineman, playing Nicole Kidman\u2019s character from HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Undoing.\u201d But time and again, the proceedings were interrupted by Strong, who continued to spin conspiracy theories (\u201cI voted for Trump, yet Biden won? Hmmm. Maybe a little too random\u201d) and confused Dominion with Domino\u2019s Pizza. (\u201cWell, for starters they cheated me out of my cheesy bread,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cEither way my vote took longer than 30 minutes so it\u2019s supposed to be free.\u201d) Before wrapping up the hearing (and the sketch), McKinnon\u2019s Giuliani vowed: \u201cI would say the defense rests, but we will never rest. Not until this election is overturned. Or I get a full pardon and $10 million in cash.\u201d It took a moment for the premise of this filmed segment to become clear: Santa Claus (played by Jason Bateman, the evening\u2019s host) and his elves (Bennett, Fineman and Kyle Mooney) read through letters from children before they come across a disturbing request from an especially dedicated Santa fan. That fan is Stu (Pete Davidson), who raps his Christmas wish as an homage to Eminem\u2019s \u201cStan\u201d: I won\u2019t be greedy or needy or ask you for too much.Just want one thing and hope you still got that magic touch.\u2018Cause getting this present is the only thing keeping me alive.Dear Santa Claus: Please bring me a PS5. The sketch also features McKinnon in the role of Dido, Eminem\u2019s collaborator on the original song; Bowen Yang as Elton John, who famously sang a duet of \u201cStan\u201d with Eminem at the 2001 Grammys; and stick around till the very end for one last surprise cameo. At the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che riffed on President Trump\u2019s failed efforts to overturn his election loss and on the distribution of coronavirus vaccines. Jost began: Yesterday, Trump\u2019s lawyers opened another door on their advent calendar of losing as they had election lawsuits tossed in six different states. Proving once again that this administration will never stop fighting \u2014 except the coronavirus. In a psychotic OnlyFans video this week, Trump said that this was a rigged election at the highest level. Dude, you\u2019re the highest level. You were in charge when the election happened. And hey, look, I will believe any conspiracy theory you want, as long as in 44 days, you leave. I will believe there were suitcases of hidden ballots. I\u2019ll believe that the votes were counted illegally in Spain. Or \u2014 this is a real theory \u2014 that North Koreans in ships dropped off ballots in Maine. Because, you know, it\u2019s easier for North Koreans to get to the East Coast. Whatever you want us to believe, sir, I am in. OK? I see you, you is smart. You is kind. You is important. But you is need to go. Che continued: The C.D.C. has recommended that the first people in the U.S. to receive Covid vaccines should be health care workers and residents of nursing homes, while the first people to actually receive it will be guests of Colin and Scarlett\u2019s holiday yacht party. I got mixed feelings on this vaccine. On one hand, I\u2019m Black, so naturally, I don\u2019t really trust it. But other the other hand, I\u2019m on a white TV show so I might actually get the real one. Speaking from the Weekend Update desk, Davidson, a well-known native of Staten Island, riffed on a recent protest at Mac\u2019s Public House, a tavern there whose owner declared the bar an \u201cautonomous zone\u201d in a rebellion against pandemic restrictions. \u201cPeople were outside the bar, shouting about freedom, taunting the cops, chanting that they should arrest the governor,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s Staten Island, so I assume that it was just a typical last call.\u201d Davidson added that a protester had \u201ccompared not being able to drink indoors to being Jewish during the Holocaust, which must have been awkward for the people there who had to suddenly pretend they believed in the Holocaust.\u201d Davidson also wondered why so many Twitter users were decrying a charity table-reading of \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d in which he will read James Stewart\u2019s role of George Bailey. \u201cIt\u2019s an old-timey film about a guy who\u2019s suicidal,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cI\u2019m famously depressed and have the complexion of someone in a black-and-white movie.\u201d The country musician Morgan Wallen was previously scheduled to appear on \u201cS.N.L.\u201d in October, but he lost that booking after several videos posted to social media showed him celebrating a University of Alabama football victory in ways that violated the show\u2019s coronavirus protocols. Two months later, Wallen was back to perform on the program and he also appeared in this sketch, in which he poked fun at his shortsighted actions. Wallen played himself, carousing at an Alabama bar, where his future self (Bateman) appeared in a puff of smoke and advised him that his actions would cost him his \u201cS.N.L.\u201d spot. (\u201cTrust me, somebody\u2019s going to post a video of you ignoring Covid protocols,\u201d Bateman told Wallen. \u201cThe whole internet\u2019s going to freak out.\u201d) Bateman, in turn, was given a warning from another future self (Yang), who urged him to reconsider \u201cthat experimental skin regimen you\u2019re going to try \u2014 it might make you too hot.\u201d",

    "article_text": "At Rally for Georgia Senators, Trump Focuses on His Own Grievances VALDOSTA, Ga. \u2014 One month before a pair of Georgia runoffs that will determine the Senate majority, President Trump used a rally for the Republican senators on Saturday to complain about his own loss last month, insisting he would still prevail and, with notably less ardor, encouraging voters here to re-elect the two lawmakers. Taking the stage for his first rally as a lame duck president, Mr. Trump immediately, and falsely, claimed victory in the presidential race. \u201cYou know we won Georgia, just so you understand,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump lost this state by just under 12,000 votes to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who won the White House with 306 electoral votes. But the president has persisted in his baseless claims that the final outcome remains in doubt. \u201cThey cheated and rigged our presidential election, but we\u2019ll still win,\u201d Mr. Trump said, offering no evidence but nonetheless prompting about 10,000 supporters gathered on the tarmac at a regional airport to chant, \u201cStop the Steal!\u201d Speaking for an hour and 40 minutes, the president did read a series of scripted lines about the two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, and repeatedly urged his supporters in Georgia to vote next month, even mentioning the deadlines for the mail-in ballots he has so often scorned. Yet he embedded those dutiful remarks of support in a deep thicket of conspiracy-mongering about his defeat and even aired a lengthy montage of video of clips from the conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network, which also depicted a sinister plot of electoral theft. Before he arrived in Valdosta, the president made no attempt to disguise his central priority as it relates to Georgia: overturning his loss in the state. He began the day with a telephone call with Gov. Brian Kemp, ostensibly to offer his condolences to the governor about the death in a car accident of a young man who was close to Mr. Kemp\u2019s family. But in truth, Mr. Trump used the call to urge Mr. Kemp, a Republican, to call the state legislature into session so the G.O.P. majorities could appoint new electors who would subvert the will of the state\u2019s voters when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 14. He has also called on Mr. Kemp to order an audit of signatures on ballots. At the rally, Mr. Trump amplified the critique he had been making of Mr. Kemp much of the day on Twitter, all but demanding that the governor overturn the will of the voters for him. \u201cYour governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing,\u201d the president said. \u201cStop it very easily.\u201d The crowd booed when he invoked Mr. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the two Georgia Republicans Mr. Trump has been demanding abet his effort to overturn Georgia\u2019s results. And they cheered when he turned to Representative Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican and Trump loyalist, and suggested he challenge Mr. Kemp in a gubernatorial primary in 2022. The president called the January races \u201cthe most important congressional runoff probably in American history\u201d and lashed the Democratic nominees, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, as \u201cfar-left liberals.\u201d But he didn\u2019t unspool the most biting attacks on them until about an hour into his remarks, and it was later still that he brought Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler to the stage for brief remarks. Mr. Perdue was nearly drowned out by the audience, which showered him with a \u201cFight for Trump\u201d chant that only grew louder when the two candidates handed the microphone back to the president. The president\u2019s supporters will not tolerate anything less than total fealty toward him. Mr. Trump\u2019s persistent lament about what he described as the \u201crigged\u201d election illustrated the quandary for Republicans. With Mr. Trump sowing distrust in Georgia\u2019s voting system, railing against the vote-counting machines the state used and falsely asserting that mail-in ballots were rife with fraud, he\u2019s giving Republicans in the state reason to question both voting by mail and in-person voting. If that prompts even a modest number of Republicans to sit out the Senate runoffs, especially in rural areas where Mr. Trump\u2019s support is strongest, it could be enough to alter the electoral math in the evenly divided state and tip the races to the Democrats. The president repeatedly sought to encourage Georgians to participate in the runoffs in the same breaths in which he railed against his own loss, offering a jarring, two-speeches-in-one presentation. \u201cYou got to get out and vote,\u201d he said just moments after venting that Republicans were purportedly \u201cnot nearly as vicious\u201d as Democrats when it came to stealing elections. In Valdosta, 250 miles south of Atlanta, supporters of the president began arriving by noon for the evening rally. Many of them had crossed the nearby state line from Florida and thus could not vote in the Senate races. The music, the red-white-and-blue stagecraft and Mr. Trump\u2019s heavily anticipated arrival were all familiar. But he showed little joy, and much of his speech was dedicated to nursing his grievances and was often reminiscent of the rambling, misinformation-filled, 45-minute video he delivered from the White House earlier in the week. \u201cI got more votes than any sitting president in history,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The president\u2019s willingness to campaign Saturday night in heavily conservative South Georgia \u2014 far from the Atlanta-area voters who rejected him last month \u2014 heartened Republican officials, who have been lobbying him to intervene in the runoffs in support of Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue. But aides worried, presciently, in the days leading to the appearance that he would go off script and attack Mr. Kemp, who has become the primary target of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter vitriol. Hoping to pacify Mr. Trump after Saturday\u2019s phone call, Mr. Kemp noted on Twitter that he had already called for an audit of the signatures on mail ballots \u201cto restore confidence in our election process.\u201d But Mr. Kemp\u2019s office has also said the governor does not have the power to unilaterally order a signature audit. Mr. Kemp did not attend the rally Saturday night because of the death of the family friend. Before Mr. Trump landed in Valdosta, Republicans took pains to emphasize the task at hand: the January runoffs. A mammoth video screen directed attendees to \u201cRequest Your Absentee Ballot Right Now!\u201d and directed them to the website to do so. And Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue both addressed the audience well before Air Force One touched down on a mild late autumn night. During a speech by Ms. Loeffler, who addressed the crowd nearly two hours before Mr. Trump spoke, the \u201cStop the steal\u201d chant broke out in the audience \u2014 in the cadence of the familiar \u201cLock her up\u201d chants that were popular during Mr. Trump\u2019s first run. Ms. Loeffler sought to redirect the crowd\u2019s energy to the runoff elections and away from the president\u2019s attempts to subvert the election results. \u201cYou\u2019re going to vote, right?\u201d she said. \u201cIf you vote, we will win. If you don\u2019t, we will lose America and what it\u2019s founded on.\u201d But as Elton John\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night\u2019s Alright (For Fighting)\u201d blared in advance of Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance, it was far from clear whom the crowd was more intent on directing its hostility toward \u2014 Democrats or the Georgia Republicans the president is scapegoating for his loss in the state. And outside the event, there were few indicators that the purpose of the rally was to elect Georgia\u2019s two Republican senators. Trump signs were ubiquitous, and the merchandisers outside were selling only Trump gear. The challenge for Republicans was evident in remarks from Mr. Perdue, who veered between encouraging the thousands in attendance to vote in the upcoming runoff and defending Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to advance his claims of fraud. \u201cI\u2019m going to fight for this president until he gets every ballot counted correctly and every illegal ballot thrown out,\u201d Mr. Perdue said. At the same time, he framed January\u2019s runoffs as a final chance for Republicans to issue a check against a Democratic administration. \u201cIf we win Georgia, we save America,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd thanks to you, we\u2019ll make sure the road to socialism never goes through the state of Georgia.\u201d Many in the audience had not accepted that Mr. Biden would be the next president. Jason Kresckey, who attended the rally with his wife, said he wanted to show support for the president. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s not going away,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that whole movement that he created was a movement that inspired a certain population of people. I just don\u2019t think that feeling is going anywhere soon.\u201d Michael D. Shear contributed reporting from Washington.",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s Final Days of Rage and Denial WASHINGTON \u2014 Over the past week, President Trump posted or reposted about 145 messages on Twitter lashing out at the results of an election he lost. He mentioned the coronavirus pandemic now reaching its darkest hours four times \u2014 and even then just to assert that he was right about the outbreak and the experts were wrong. Moody and by accounts of his advisers sometimes depressed, the president barely shows up to work, ignoring the health and economic crises afflicting the nation and largely clearing his public schedule of meetings unrelated to his desperate bid to rewrite the election results. He has fixated on rewarding friends, purging the disloyal and punishing a growing list of perceived enemies that now includes Republican governors, his own attorney general and even Fox News. The final days of the Trump presidency have taken on the stormy elements of a drama more common to history or literature than a modern White House. His rage and detached-from-reality refusal to concede defeat evoke images of a besieged overlord in some distant land defiantly clinging to power rather than going into exile or an erratic English monarch imposing his version of reality on his cowed court. And while he will leave office in 46 days, the last few weeks may only foreshadow what he will be like after he departs. Mr. Trump will almost certainly try to shape the national conversation from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and his relentless campaign to discredit the election could undercut his successor, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. Although many Republicans would like to move on, he appears intent on forcing them to remain in thrall to his need for vindication and vilification even after his term expires. On Saturday night, Mr. Trump took his unreality show to Georgia for his first major public appearance since the Nov. 3 election. A rally to support two Republican senators in a runoff next month offered a high-profile opportunity to vent his grievances and promote his false claims that he was somehow cheated of a second term by a vast conspiracy. \u201cYou know we won Georgia, just so you understand,\u201d he told supporters in a state that he lost by 12,000 votes, adding that he actually won other states where in fact he lost too. \u201cThey cheated and they rigged our presidential election, but we will still win it,\u201d he declared as he pressured Republican state officials to overturn the results. \u201cWe just need somebody with courage to do what they have to do.\u201d At times, Mr. Trump\u2019s railing-against-his-fate outbursts seem like a story straight out of William Shakespeare, part tragedy, part farce, full of sound and fury. Is Mr. Trump a modern-day Julius Caesar, forsaken by even some of his closest courtiers? (Et tu, Bill Barr?) Or a King Richard III who wars with the nobility until being toppled by Henry VII? Or King Lear, railing against those who do not love and appreciate him sufficiently? How sharper than a serpent\u2019s tooth it is to have a thankless electorate. \u201cThis is classic Act V behavior,\u201d said Jeffrey R. Wilson, a Shakespearean scholar at Harvard who published the book \u201cShakespeare and Trump\u201d this year. \u201cThe forces are being picked off and the tyrant is holed up in his castle and he\u2019s growing increasingly anxious and he feels insecure and he starts blustering about his legitimate sovereignty and he starts accusing the opposition of treason.\u201d Others hear echoes from the East, recalling autocrats in the far reaches of the former Soviet Union barricading themselves in presidential palaces while furiously spinning out enemies-of-the-people propaganda to justify holding onto power after popular uprisings. Alina Polyakova, the president of the Center for European Policy Analysis and a Russia scholar, said Mr. Trump reminded her of President Vladimir V. Putin, who has largely withdrawn from view recently amid public discontent in the late stages of an aging regime. \u201cBoth also seem to be living in alternate realities surrounded only by those who confirm those realities,\u201d she said. \u201cBut whereas one brooder will weather a slow and long decline, the other is increasingly facing a rapid decline and scrambling to do what he can to save his family and loyalists \u2014 and of course himself.\u201d Students of the American presidency, on the other hand, could think of no recent parallel. \u201cAs we move toward Inauguration Day, I have thought almost daily of a remark attributed to Henry Adams: \u2018I expected the worst, and it was worse than I expected,\u2019\u201d said Patricia O\u2019Toole, a biographer of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson as well as Adams. Unlike any of his modern predecessors, Mr. Trump has not called his victorious opponent, much less invited him to the White House for the traditional postelection visit. Mr. Trump has indicated that he may not attend Mr. Biden\u2019s inauguration, which would make him the first sitting president since 1869 to refuse to participate in the most important ritual of the peaceful transfer of power. He has been enabled by Republican leaders unwilling to stand up to him, even if many privately wish he would go away sooner rather than later. After being called \u201cprofiles in cowardice\u201d by an ally of the president, 75 Republican state legislators from Pennsylvania on Friday disavowed their own election and called on Congress to reject the state\u2019s electors for Mr. Biden. Only 27 of 249 Republican members of Congress surveyed by The Washington Post publicly acknowledged Mr. Biden\u2019s victory. Mr. Trump condemned them on Saturday as \u201cRINOS,\u201d meaning Republicans in name only. \u201cHe really has paid attention to the base,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, a friend of the president\u2019s and chief executive of Newsmax, part of the conservative news media megaphone that has amplified Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations. \u201cThey got him elected and in his mind got him elected the second time. And they\u2019re strongly in favor of this recount effort and they want him to continue this. In his mind, he\u2019s not just doing this for himself he\u2019s doing it for his supporters and for the country. He\u2019s on a mission and he\u2019s not going to be easily swayed.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed is a fire hose of denial. \u201cNO WAY WE LOST THIS ELECTION,\u201d he wrote at one point in recent days. \u201cWe won Michigan by a lot!\u201d he wrote at another of a state he lost by more than 154,000 votes. He reposted a message seeking to delegitimize Mr. Biden: \u201cIf he is inaugurated under these circumstances, he cannot be considered \u2018president\u2019 but instead referred to as the #presidentialoccupant.\u201d And he has turned on his own party, angry that Republican leaders have refused to accept his baseless claims and overturn the will of the voters. Shortly before arriving in Georgia on Saturday, Mr. Trump called Gov. Brian Kemp to press him to convene a special legislative session to supplant the results there, then lashed out at the governor at the rally for rebuffing him. \u201cYour governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He also tweeted that Mr. Kemp and Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, another Republican stalwart, \u201cfight harder against us than do the Radical Left Dems.\u201d He has been riled that his invented claims have been widely refuted. \u201cMany people in the media \u2014 and even judges \u2014 so far have refused to accept it,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a rambling 46-minute videotaped rant from the White House this past week. \u201cThey know it\u2019s true. They know it\u2019s there. They know who won the election, but they refuse to say you\u2019re right. Our country needs somebody to say, \u2018You\u2019re right.\u2019 \u201d But even as the president desperately demands that somebody, anybody, tell him that he is right, no one in a position of authority has done so other than blood relatives, paid lawyers and partisan soul mates. The election has been certified and accepted not just by Democrats but also by key Republican governors, secretaries of state, election officials, city clerks, judges and even Trump administration officials. After his own cybersecurity czar endorsed the integrity of the election, Mr. Trump fired him. Now that Attorney General William P. Barr has said he saw no fraud that would overturn the results, he may be next. Mr. Trump\u2019s video was so out of touch with the facts that both Facebook and Twitter appended warning notices lest viewers actually believe what the president of the United States was telling them. Which explains why the only topic other than the election to draw Mr. Trump\u2019s interest over the last week was the annual defense bill that he vowed to veto because Congress did not strip legal protection for big technology companies as he has demanded. By contrast, he expressed little interest in the coronavirus now ravaging the country or the resulting economic devastation. Rather than \u201crounding the corner,\u201d as Mr. Trump insisted once again on Saturday night, the pandemic this past week began killing a record high of nearly 3,000 people in the United States every day, almost the equivalent of another Sept. 11, 2001, attack every 24 hours. Mr. Trump made no comment on that in his Twitter rants nor about the latest jobs report documenting the economic toll. His only four tweets mentioning the virus were about defending his own handling of it, including reposted messages asserting that \u201cThe president was RIGHT.\u201d As the circle around Mr. Trump shrinks and even allies like Mr. Barr distance themselves, the president resists any suggestion that he stand down. \u201cI\u2019m never, ever going to concede,\u201d he told one ally who urged him to prepare to do so. And if he is not listening to advisers, many are no longer listening to him. At one point, Mr. Trump appeared to telephone Mr. Ducey even as he was certifying Arizona\u2019s results on live television and the governor refused to take the president\u2019s call, which was announced by a \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d ring tone. Top Republican lawyers have dropped off his election lawsuits, which have been dismissed by the dozens and even in one case declared \u201cbizarre\u201d by a judge appointed by Mr. Trump. Five courts in five battleground states rejected his latest legal challenges to the election in a little more than three hours on Friday, with a Wisconsin judge warning that \u201cthis is a dangerous path we are being asked to tread.\u201d Sliding further from the mainstream, the president has aligned himself more with fringe news outlets like One America News Network and the conspiracy theorists of QAnon, who believe the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles plotting against Mr. Trump. In a meeting with Republican senators, according to an official confirming a report in The Post, Mr. Trump said QAnon followers \u201cbasically believe in good government,\u201d a comment that left the room silent until his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, volunteered that he had never heard them described that way. With six weeks until he leaves office, Mr. Trump remains as unpredictable and erratic as ever. He may fire Mr. Barr or others, issue a raft of pardons to protect himself and his allies or incite a confrontation overseas. Like King Lear, he may fly into further rages and find new targets for his wrath. \u201cIf there are these analogies between classic literature and society as it\u2019s operating right now, then that should give us some big cause for concern this December,\u201d said Mr. Wilson, the Shakespearean scholar. \u201cWe\u2019re approaching the end of the play here and that\u2019s where catastrophe always comes.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Judge Orders Government to Fully Reinstate DACA Program A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to fully restore an Obama-era program designed to shield young, undocumented immigrants from deportation, dealing what could be a final blow to President Trump\u2019s long-fought effort to end the protections. The program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was created by President Barack Obama in 2012. Over the years, it has protected more than 800,000 individuals, known as \u201cdreamers,\u201d who met a series of strict requirements for eligibility. But those protections have been under legal and political siege from Republicans for years, leaving the immigrants who were enrolled in DACA uncertain whether the threat of deportation from the United States could quickly return with a single court order or presidential memorandum. Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn directed the administration on Friday to allow newly eligible immigrants to file new applications for protection under the program, reversing a memorandum issued in the summer by Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, which restricted the program to people who were already enrolled. As many as 300,000 new applicants could now be eligible, according to the lawyers who pushed for the reinstatement. The memo from the Department of Homeland Security also limited benefits under the program, including permits to work, to one year, but the judge ordered the government to restore them to a full two years. Judge Garaufis, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, also said the government must find a way to contact all immigrants who are eligible for the program to inform them of the change. The judge said the government must announce the changes to the program on its website by Monday. Lawyers who had challenged the Trump administration in the case celebrated the decision, saying that amid a pandemic and global economic recession, it granted some stability to a vulnerable group. \u201cThis is a really big day for DACA recipients and immigrant young people,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, director of the Justice Action Center, who litigated the class-action case. \u201cIt\u2019s a day that many of them have been waiting for for over three years.\u201d She said it could open the door for hundreds of thousands of immigrant youths \u201cwho have been unfairly denied their chance\u201d under the DACA program. The program still faces other challenges, including a case in federal court in Texas, where Republican attorneys general have asked a judge to declare it unlawful. And Mr. Trump\u2019s administration could appeal the ruling by Judge Garaufis in the days ahead. Immigration advocates said they hoped the administration would not continue its legal fight to end the program given the arrival of a new, Democratic administration in less than two months. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has vowed to restore the DACA program when he takes office, but a legislative solution that would permanently allow the dreamers to live and work legally in the United States remains elusive, leaving their fates to the shifting political winds in Washington. If the judge\u2019s order still stands by the time Mr. Biden takes office in January, the new president would need to do nothing to make good on his promise. But Mr. Biden is certain to face intense pressure from immigrant groups to fight for a broad overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws that would take care of the dreamers and millions of other undocumented immigrants. Comprehensive legislation, including one that would provide a path to citizenship for some immigrants, would be less vulnerable to legal challenges than DACA, which Mr. Obama created using the executive powers of his office after Congress repeatedly refused to act. But securing passage of a bill that includes citizenship for undocumented immigrants could be difficult for Mr. Biden, especially if Republicans still control the Senate after two runoff elections in Georgia early in January. Americans have historically considered DACA beneficiaries to be among the most sympathetic categories of immigrants. Having violated immigration laws through no fault of their own by being brought to the United States as minors, they are required to have a high school diploma or G.E.D., unless they have served in the military, and they must maintain a clean criminal record to hold on to their status. In a Pew survey conducted in June, about three-quarters of respondents, including majorities of both Democrats and Republicans, favored extending a pathway to permanent legal status to dreamers. The program has had generational impact. Researchers estimate that 250,000 U.S.-born children have at least one parent who is enrolled in DACA, and that about 1.5 million people in the United States live with a beneficiary of the program. The judge\u2019s ruling on Friday is a significant legal setback to Mr. Trump\u2019s yearslong attempt to terminate the program. As a candidate, Mr. Trump insisted that DACA was unconstitutional, and as president he moved to end it in September 2017. That effort was put on hold by federal judges while the merits of the president\u2019s actions were evaluated. The legal battle culminated in a Supreme Court ruling this summer in which the justices said the president had not followed proper procedures to end the program. In the wake of that ruling, Mr. Wolf only partially reinstated the program, refusing to allow new immigrants to apply and slashing the length of renewals to one year, instead of the two years previously allowed. In November, Judge Garaufis determined that the partial reinstatement was invalid because it had been issued in the form of a memo by Mr. Wolf, who Judge Garaufis found had been unlawfully appointed to his position. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday night. But the administration has disputed the judge\u2019s determination that Mr. Wolf was not properly appointed and has signaled in the past that it intends to fight challenges to the president\u2019s efforts to end or scale back the program.

    "article_text": "Trump Orders All American Troops Out of Somalia WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, pressing his end-of-term troop withdrawals from conflicts around the world, will pull American forces out of Somalia, where they have been trying to push back advances by Islamist insurgents in the Horn of Africa. The Pentagon announced on Friday that virtually all of the approximately 700 troops in Somalia \u2014 most Special Operations forces who have been conducting training and counterterrorism missions \u2014 will be leaving by Jan. 15, five days before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is scheduled to be inaugurated. The withdrawal from Somalia followed Mr. Trump\u2019s orders to reduce the American presence in Afghanistan and Iraq, and reflected the president\u2019s longstanding desire to end long-running military engagements against Islamist insurgencies in failed and fragile countries in Africa and the Middle East, a grinding mission that has spread since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The debate over the value of counterterrorism and training missions like the one in Somalia, the site of the bloody \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d debacle in 1993, is growing \u2014 among the public, in Congress and even in the Pentagon. Among the points of contention is whether the United States should expend life and treasure for shadowy security operations in remote parts of the world. But Mr. Trump\u2019s push to leave Somalia before he leaves office comes at a delicate time for the East African nation: It is preparing for parliamentary elections next month and a presidential election scheduled for early February. The removal of American troops could complicate any ability to keep election rallies and voting safe from Shabab bombers. It also comes at a time of political turmoil in neighboring Ethiopia, whose army has also battled the Shabab. Supporters of the mission say it is important for the United States to continue strikes on militants and to help train government forces to prevent their territory from becoming a haven for planning terrorist strikes, much like how Al Qaeda plotted the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks from a home base in Afghanistan. Even some of Mr. Trump\u2019s staunchest Republican allies in Congress have warned against troop cuts in Somalia. \u201cThis strategy has worked, and our continued presence there has prevented Al Shabab from expanding its foothold in the region,\u201d Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement this fall when hints of Mr. Trump\u2019s likely actions surfaced. Many of the American troops will be \u201crepositioned\u201d to nearby Kenya, a Defense Department official said Friday. That means airstrikes by drones on militants in Somalia could continue, but efforts to effectively train local security forces on the ground would end. It was not immediately clear whether other parts of the American presence in Somalia \u2014 such as C.I.A. officers, the ambassador and other State Department diplomats who are based at a heavily fortified bunker at the airport in Mogadishu, the Somali capital \u2014 will also withdraw. The Pentagon pledged that efforts to safeguard American interests would continue. \u201cThe U.S. is not withdrawing or disengaging from Africa,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe remain committed to our African partners and enduring support through a whole-of-government approach.\u201d The United States will retain the ability to conduct counterterrorism operations in Somalia, especially drone strikes, and to collect early warnings and indicators regarding threats to the United States and allies from militant forces in the country. \u201cAs a result of this decision, some forces may be reassigned outside of East Africa,\u201d the statement said, adding that \u201cthe remaining forces will be repositioned from Somalia into neighboring countries in order to allow cross-border operations by both U.S. and partner forces to maintain pressure against violent extremist organizations operating in Somalia.\u201d The mission in Somalia has been in the spotlight in recent days, after it was reported that a veteran C.I.A. officer was killed in combat in Somalia, according to current and former American officials. The death has already rekindled debate over American intelligence\u2019s counterterrorism operations in Africa. The officer was a member of the C.I.A.\u2019s paramilitary division, the Special Activities Center, and a former member of the Navy\u2019s elite SEAL Team 6. Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump ordered the military to withdraw forces from Afghanistan, halving the number there to just over 2,000. Reductions in the American troop presence in Iraq also are underway. Also this week, the Pentagon policy official overseeing the military\u2019s efforts to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was fired after a White House appointee told him that the United States had won that war and that his office had been disbanded. The ouster of the official, Christopher P. Maier, the chief of the Pentagon\u2019s \u201cDefeat ISIS\u201d task force since March 2017, came just three weeks after Mr. Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and three other Pentagon officials and replaced them with loyalists. The acting defense secretary, Christopher C. Miller, who has been carrying out Mr. Trump\u2019s purge at the Pentagon since he took over from Mr. Esper last month, characterized the moves as a reflection of the success of the American-led effort to crush the terrorist state that the Islamic State created in large sections of Iraq and Syria. Defense Department officials familiar with internal deliberations said the Somalia pullout would not apply to American forces stationed in nearby Kenya and Djibouti, where American drones that carry out airstrikes in Somalia are based. Keeping those air bases would mean retaining the military\u2019s ability to use drones to attack militants with the Shabab, a Qaeda-linked terrorist group \u2014 at least those deemed to pose a threat to American interests. Since Mr. Trump ran for office in 2016, exiting foreign conflicts has been a central component of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. That appeal has particularly animated his base of populist voters, many of them veterans who have grown weary of their roles in longstanding wars. The president views his record on the issue as important to any political future he might pursue. Most American troops in Somalia are Special Operations forces stationed at a small number of bases across the country. Their missions include training and advising Somali Army and counterterrorism troops and conducting kill-or-capture raids targeting Shabab militants. The Pentagon has long argued that the United States can safely leave areas contested by militants when the local governments can safeguard their own territory. Mr. Trump\u2019s order means direct training efforts with Somalia security forces would end. For years, Somalia has faced civil war, droughts and violence from Islamist extremists. The United States intervened in the country as peacekeepers, but abandoned it not long after the \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d battle in 1993, which killed 18 Americans and hundreds of militia fighters. The Shabab, whose name means \u201cthe youth,\u201d emerged around 2007 and have violently vied for control of Somalia with occasional attacks outside its borders, including a shooting in 2013 at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, that killed more than five dozen civilians and a deadly assault in January on an American air base at Manda Bay, Kenya. Shabab leaders pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda in 2012. In 2016, shortly before leaving office, Obama administration officials deemed them part of the congressionally authorized war against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks. Under the Trump administration, the military sharply increased airstrikes targeting Shabab militants.",

But with the virus now in its darkest phase \u2014 and hospitalizations and daily caseloads shattering records \u2014 the White House remains largely silent on the devastation being wrought around the country and continues to do little to amplify guidance from the C.D.C. that could help stem the spread. And while Mr. Pence sought to offer an upbeat assessment, Dr. Henry Walke, who directs the C.D.C.\u2019s Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections, presented a far more sobering picture. \u201cHospitalizations are still rising and it\u2019s a real problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care providers are overstressed, beds are full.\u201d The C.D.C. issued new guidance on Friday urging state and local governments to put forth universal face mask directives in indoor settings outside the home, among other measures in the agency\u2019s first comprehensive list of strategies for combating the coronavirus.

Mr. Pence\u2019s C.D.C. visit came ahead of a \u201cvaccine summit\u201d at the White House on Tuesday featuring him, President Trump, government officials and industry workers.

    "article_text": "Pelosi voices optimism on stimulus after McConnell agrees to compromise on a year-end spending bill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi flashed fresh optimism on Friday that the House and Senate could soon reach a bipartisan deal on an elusive pandemic stimulus plan after she and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, agreed to try to find an agreement that could be merged with an enormous year-end spending package. \u201cThat would be our hope because that is the vehicle leaving the station,\u201d Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, said at a news conference in the Capitol Friday morning, a day after her conversation with Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. The phone call marked their first conversation since the election. Though Ms. Pelosi conceded there were still obstacles to an agreement, she insisted there would be \u201csufficient time\u201d to close a deal before the Dec. 11 government funding deadline. She pointed to lower-than-expected job gains reported on Friday as an added accelerant. \u201cThere is momentum. There is momentum,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cThe tone of our conversations is one that is indicative of the decision to get the job done.\u201d Mr. McConnell expressed similar resolve on Thursday, although he stopped short of endorsing the $908 billion outline proposed by a bipartisan group of moderates that Ms. Pelosi has said should be the starting point for talks, instead pressing for a far smaller bill. Stimulus talks have been stalemated for months, with lawmakers unable to resolve differences over issues like liability protections for businesses, a Republican demand that Democrats have resisted, and providing federal aid to state and local governments, a top priority for Democrats that many Republicans oppose. They are also still struggling to resolve a number of policy disputes in the must-pass bills needed to keep the government funded beyond Dec. 11, though most involved in the process say that a resolution is feasible before the end of the year. After months of insisting they would not accept a slimmed-down relief bill, Democrats now appear poised to accept less than one third of the spending they initially proposed to prop up small businesses, help the uninsured and jobless, boost state and local governments, and meet immediate public health needs, leaving other priorities unaddressed until President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes office Jan. 20. The emerging compromise would revive lapsed federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week for 18 weeks, and provide billions of dollars in funding for small businesses, schools and the imminent distribution of a vaccine. While a bipartisan group of senators is expected to continue working on finalizing legislative text through the weekend, there remain a number of significant hurdles. The policy divides that have helped derail attempts to reach agreement earlier this year persist even as lawmakers circulate a tentative outline. Pressed on her reversal, Ms. Pelosi was defensive on Friday, saying her earlier, multitrillion-dollar proposals that the Senate called nonstarters were important parts of a negotiating strategy that may now yield results. She insisted that Mr. Biden\u2019s election and the looming arrival of two vaccines amounted to \u201ca total game-changer.\u201d \u201cPresident-elect Biden has said this package would be at best just a start,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we see it, as well. It is less money, but over a shorter period of time, and we need to do it to saves lives and livelihood with the hope that much more help is on the way.\u201d",

So what might he do in the closing days of his administration, when presidents have often made freest use of this power? Mr. Trump has discussed granting three of his children, his son-in-law and his personal lawyer pardons protecting them from charges that have not yet been filed. Such pre-emptive pardons have been a rarity in American history, granted with the stated intention of sparing the nation from dangerous divisions.  We look ahead to a potential wave of pardons and commutations \u2014 and explore who could benefit.  Michael S. Schmidt, a Washington correspondent for The New York Times.  Speculation about pardon activity at the White House is churning furiously, underscoring how much the Trump administration has been dominated by investigations and criminal prosecutions of people in the president\u2019s orbit.

Even in defeat, President Trump continued to raise money at some of the fastest rates of the year, pulling in $207.5 million in the month since Election Day with the Republican National Committee as he has stoked unfounded fears of election fraud and made baseless claims to undermine the legitimacy of the election. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign apparatus has continued to aggressively solicit donations under the guise of supporting his various legal challenges to the election of Joseph R. Biden Jr., but as of now 75 percent of donations go to to a new political action committee that Mr. Trump formed in mid-November and 25 percent to the Republican Party. Only if a donor gives more than $6,000 do those funds go to Mr. Trump\u2019s formal \u201crecount\u201d account. His campaign did not release a breakdown of how the $207.5 million was divided, with funds split between the new PAC, paying off his campaign debts, the R.N.C. and two committees operated jointly by the party and the campaign. \u201cThese tremendous fund-raising numbers show President Trump remains the leader and source of energy for the Republican Party,\u201d Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement. Mr. Trump, who has not formally conceded the 2020 race but has begun talking about running again in 2024, has repeatedly challenged the results in court with virtually no success. In his statement, Mr. Stepien added that the money \u201calso positions President Trump to continue leading the fight to clean up our corrupt elections process in so many areas around the country, and to build on gains from the 2020 elections so we can take back the House and build on our Senate majority in 2022.\u201d The Thursday announcement came on a final filing deadline of the 2020 race with the Federal Election Commission, which covers the period from Oct. 15 to Nov. 23. During that period, the R.N.C., Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and their shared committees raised a combined $495 million, campaign officials announced. As of early evening, only the R.N.C. had filed its report, which showed it ended the period with $58.8 million cash on hand. As Mr. Trump has contested the results in multiple venues, the party had spent more than $6 million on legal bills, with $1.4 million going to the Jones Day law firm, $1.3 million to King and Spalding and more than $920,000 to Consovoy McCarthy.",

    "article_text": "A Trump Fed Pick Squeaks Through Senate Confirmation WASHINGTON \u2014 Christopher Waller, nominated by President Trump to the Federal Reserve\u2019s seven-member Board of Governors, was confirmed by a narrow margin on Thursday as Republican senators scramble to fill open slots before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. assumes office. Mr. Waller, a regional Fed research official, had been up for Senate confirmation alongside Judy Shelton, whose long-held preference for some type of gold standard and apparent skepticism of Fed independence hurt her chances of confirmation. Mr. Waller made it through, but just barely, with a nearly party line vote of 48 to 47. Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, joined Democrats in voting against Mr. Waller. Mr. Waller\u2019s selection means that Mr. Biden will take office with a Fed stocked with picks from Mr. Trump, who has now chosen five of the central bank\u2019s six sitting officials, including appointing Jerome H. Powell as its chair. The board will have one remaining open slot if Ms. Shelton is not confirmed. While the sitting governors have varying time left in their 14-year terms, Mr. Waller was appointed to an unexpired slot that stretches through early 2030. The White House announced that it would tap Mr. Waller and Ms. Shelton in mid-2019, but their nominations \u2014 long treated as a pair \u2014 faced a roller-coaster confirmation process as senators grappled with misgivings over Ms. Shelton. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and a Republican of Kentucky, tried but failed to bring her nomination to a vote in November. Her path to confirmation became even less likely given the changing makeup of the Senate. Senator Mark Kelly, the newly elected Democrat from Arizona, was sworn in this week, and his likely no vote could kill Ms. Shelton\u2019s razor-thin chance of passing, because she already faced opposition from several Republicans. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, told reporters that Ms. Shelton\u2019s confirmation is \u201cunlikely\u201d after the changeover.

Jerome Powell was appointed as a governor by President Obama and subsequently appointed as chair by President Trump. Randal K. Quarles served as an acting governor for several months in 2018 pending his renomination. By Eleanor Lutz Though he was a conventional pick for the job, Mr. Waller\u2019s confirmation passed by the narrowest margin of any governor going back to at least 1980 and probably ever, based on data collected by a George Washington University professor, Sarah Binder. The partisan rancor shows how the process of appointing Fed governors \u2014 once drama free \u2014 has changed over the past decade. Both Mr. Trump and former President Barack Obama struggled to get nominees on the Fed board as political fights have erupted over who should fill seats on the powerful body, which plays a central role in setting interest rates and in shaping financial regulation. It also underlines the unusual path Mr. McConnell took in trying to push Fed officials through confirmation so late in the game. Mr. Waller is the first nominee ever confirmed during a lame-duck session, the period after an election but before a new administration enters the White House, according to the Fed historian Peter Conti-Brown. \u201cEverything has become hyper-politicized, and the Fed is no exception,\u201d said Mark Spindel, who with Ms. Binder wrote a book on politics at and around the Fed. \u201cFilling those spots with Trump appointees just limits what Biden can do.\u201d The Fed\u2019s Washington-based board members hold constant votes on monetary policy, while most of the 12 regional bank presidents rotate in and out of four voting seats. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is the exception, holding a permanent vote. The board members, called governors, also vote on the regulations that govern the nation\u2019s largest banks. Interest-rate setting is usually not a partisan exercise, and policy preferences do not split cleanly along ideological lines. But bank oversight tends to be more political, with Republicans favoring lighter oversight and Democrats pushing for more stringent rules. Despite the drama, Mr. Waller\u2019s confirmation was received as good news by many in the central banking community. He is a seasoned economist who has worked in academia and, most recently, as research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Mr. Waller\u2019s research has covered topics including central bank independence \u2014 \u201cthe key tool to ensure a government will not misuse monetary policy\u201d \u2014 and he has laid out a rationale for keeping borrowing costs cheap when prices are increasing slowly, as they have been in recent years. The Fed raises or lowers interest rates to slow or speed up the economy, hoping to keep inflation slow and stable while maximizing employment. Before joining the Fed in 2009, Mr. Waller was a professor in the economics department at Notre Dame. He has a doctorate from Washington State University. It is not clear whether he will be installed at the Fed in time for the central bank\u2019s Dec. 15-16 meeting. \u201cHe\u2019s been an excellent research director,\u201d Robert S. Kaplan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said of Mr. Waller, calling him an \u201cexcellent economist\u201d with a \u201ckeen mind.\u201d",

    "article_text": "President-Elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.: They Dare Not Speak His Name WASHINGTON \u2014 Funny what passes for a jolting revelation at the Capitol these days. Senator Mitch McConnell had just uttered a sentence that in more normal times would be received \u2014 and quickly forgotten \u2014 as just the kind of drab boilerplate that the Senate majority leader, a Kentucky Republican, is known for. \u201cI think we all know that after the first of the year, there\u2019s likely to be a discussion about some additional package of some size next year,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Tuesday as he discussed prospects for a coronavirus relief bill. At which point he delivered his bombshell: \u201cDepending on what the new administration wants to pursue.\u201d Aha! He said \u201cnew administration.\u201d Implying there would be an outgoing president. If President Trump had won re-election, as he keeps insisting \u2014 and which few Republican senators will publicly disabuse him of \u2014 there would be no \u201cnew administration\u201d to speak of. In other words, Mr. McConnell, in his own circuitous and perhaps unintentional way, was acknowledging that Mr. Trump had lost. Maybe he did not mean to be so forthcoming. It is, after all, a delicate verbal dance that Mr. McConnell and many of his fellow Republican senators are engaged in. They do not wish to alienate the apparently significant portion of the party\u2019s base that still believes that Mr. Trump won, or antagonize the president to the point that he torments them with future grudges, tweets and primary challengers from what will become the next de facto Republican home office, Mar-a-Lago. As such, when Mr. McConnell was asked directly about Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims, he reverted to his bland, inscrutable form. \u201cThe future will take care of itself,\u201d he said. This would seem beyond dispute. Privately, pretty much all Republican senators acknowledge that yes, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. will be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Jan. 20. This includes even Mr. Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters, like Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who admitted as much to Mark Becker, a former Republican official in the state. Mr. Becker recounted a conversation he had had with Mr. Johnson on Wednesday in The Bulwark, a website with a heavy bent toward \u201cNever Trump\u201d conservatism. When Mr. Becker asked Mr. Johnson why he had never acknowledged this election result in public, Mr. Johnson explained that to do so would be \u201cpolitical suicide.\u201d (It appears likely that Mr. Johnson believed this conversation was private.) In recent weeks, the unwillingness of most Senate and House Republicans to acknowledge an obvious election result has reached new levels of absurd. Whenever another prominent Republican official admits that Mr. Biden in fact won, the media updates the scoreboard like it\u2019s breaking news \u2014 as if a new state had been called on election night. Senators Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, Ben Sasse and Susan Collins declared this early, as did former President George W. Bush, his brother Jeb Bush, and a bunch of Republican governors and members of Congress. To reiterate what should now be indisputable: Mr. Biden won the election. Every serious news outlet in the United States has declared it. Nearly every lawsuit that Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team has filed disputing results in multiple states has failed \u2014 laughably in many cases. and Attorney General William P. Barr announced Tuesday that he had seen zero proof of fraud that would meaningfully affect the outcome. (Mr. Trump is reportedly furious at Mr. Barr for saying this.) Mr. Biden has received nearly seven million more votes than Mr. Trump, and he has amassed an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232, with virtually all ballots counted. It appeared last Sunday that Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, had joined the ranks of the sky-is-blue caucus when he referred to the \u201cBiden administration\u201d in an interview with CNN. This was of added significance because Mr. Blunt is the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees inaugural activities. \u201cWe are working with the Biden administration,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. \u201cLikely administration,\u201d he corrected himself. Ms. Bash pressed Mr. Blunt on whether this meant Mr. Biden was in fact the \u201cpresident-elect.\u201d Not so fast, he said. \u201cWell, the president-elect will be the president-elect when the electors vote for him,\u201d Mr. Blunt said, referring to the meeting of the Electoral College that is scheduled for Dec. 14. \u201cThere is no official job of president-elect,\u201d Mr. Blunt explained, though this had not stopped him from congratulating \u201cPresident-elect\u201d Donald J. Trump in a statement the day after Mr. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. In lieu of explicitly saying that Mr. Biden won, most Republicans are at least willing to engage in public discourse predicated on that reality. They have, for instance, repeatedly said that the two Senate seats up for grabs in a Georgia runoff election next month would determine which party controlled the chamber. If both Republican incumbents, Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, lose, the Senate would be 50-50, and Democrats would win the majority \u2014 an assumption premised on Senator Kamala Harris becoming the vice president and presiding over the Senate and being tasked with breaking tied votes. Several have weighed in on Mr. Biden\u2019s cabinet nominees. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, deemed the president-elect\u2019s choice to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden, \u201cradioactive.\u201d Mr. Cornyn also lamented that Mr. Biden\u2019s team had not sought \u201cconsultation\u201d from Republicans before making the choice (which would of course not be necessary if Mr. Biden had lost and was just spitballing). Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, hopped on Twitter on Wednesday to suggest a few good candidates to be the next secretary of agriculture \u201cif Biden becomes pres.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence even made the trip to Capitol Hill to swear in the newly elected Democratic senator from Arizona, Mark Kelly, while Mr. Pence\u2019s boss continued to rail against the results in that state (which were formally certified Monday). When asked after Mr. Kelly\u2019s swearing-in whether this meant he accepted the election results, Mr. Pence did not respond to reporters. Things get trickier when Republicans are asked directly whether they accept the results of the election, as reporters have been pressing them to do pretty much daily since Nov. 3. In normal times (how long before we retire that qualifier?), this question would yield some variation on the same obvious and broadly accepted response: \u201cYes.\u201d Alas, these are not normal times. \u201cThis has not been a conventional presidency,\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, summarized for reporters when he was asked why he and other Republicans have not raised concerns about the president\u2019s repeated and false claims that the election was \u201crigged\u201d or \u201cstolen.\u201d Since Mr. Trump was sworn in, Republicans have repeatedly sought verbal refuge in the \u201cunconventional\u201d nature of this presidency. This has been something of a blanket response to questions about his latest incendiary conduct. From Day 1, these statements have involved a willingness to indulge \u201calternative facts,\u201d as Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, said in defense of the untrue assertion by Sean Spicer, then the press secretary, that Mr. Trump had drawn \u201cthe largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period.\u201d In other words, an administration that began with a whopping assertion of \u201calternative facts\u201d is concluding with similarly outlandish claims about an alternative election result.

    "article_text": "New U.S. Citizenship Test Is Longer and More Difficult The Trump administration is rolling out sweeping changes to the test immigrants must take to become United States citizens, injecting hints of conservative philosophy and making the test harder for many learners of the English language. The new citizenship test that went into effect on Tuesday is longer than before, with applicants now required to answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly instead of six out of 10. It is also more complex, eliminating simple geography and adding dozens of possible questions, some nuanced and involving complex phrasing, that could trip up applicants who do not consider them carefully. Of the 18 questions removed from the previous test, 11 were questions that had simple, sometimes one-word answers. The new test adds one more hurdle for immigrants who hope to become voting citizens, coming in the waning days of an administration that has imposed substantial new barriers to immigration and limits on the ability of those already in the country to aspire to legal residence and, eventually, naturalization. One test question that has drawn particular scrutiny provides a new answer to the question, \u201cWho does a U.S. Senator represent?\u201d Previously, the answer was \u201call people of the state\u201d; on the new test, it is \u201ccitizens\u201d in the state. Singled out for a new question is the 10th Amendment, which reserves to the states all powers not specifically granted to the federal government, a part of the Bill of Rights that is a favorite among conservatives questioning federal authority. Another new question, \u201cWhy did the United States enter the Vietnam War?\u201d has one answer that is considered correct: \u201cto stop the spread of Communism.\u201d The test does not take on the issue of the vehement protests or the huge death toll stemming from the war. Immigration organizations, including some that have helped thousands of people complete their naturalization applications over the past decade, warn that the new test could make it harder for poor immigrants from non-English-speaking countries to become citizens and ultimately suppress the number of immigrants who vote. Critics also said the new test could create even more backlogs in a system already plagued with delays. \u201cIt\u2019s a last-ditch effort on their way out the door for the administration to keep people from realizing their dreams of becoming citizens,\u201d said Eric Cohen, executive director of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in San Francisco, a nonprofit group that helps permanent residents apply for citizenship. \u201cThere is no legal reason, no regulatory reason to do this,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, noting that the citizenship test had remained unchanged since 2008. \u201cThey decided on their own that they have to change it for political reasons.\u201d Dan Hetlage, a spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees the naturalization process, said in a statement that the test was revised \u201cto ensure that it remains an instrument that comprehensively assesses applicants\u2019 knowledge of American history, government and values and supports assimilation.\u201d President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has the option of reversing the changes, though that likely could not occur, if at all, until several months into the new year. The new test will be required of all applicants who apply for citizenship after Dec. 1, though there is often a lag of several months between when candidates apply and when they are scheduled for an interview with a U.S.C.I.S. officer, meaning that some candidates may still be taking the old test. The current pass rate for the citizenship test, according to U.S.C.I.S., is 91 percent. An analysis of the new test by the Catholic Legal Immigration Network suggested that 40 questions out of the original 100 remained unchanged from the previous version; the rest were reworded or newly introduced. Already, some immigrants were expressing nervousness about changes to the test. Nefi Reyes, an electrician from El Salvador who took the earlier test this year, passed with a perfect score. It had been 30 years since he had crossed the border into the United States to escape the civil war in El Salvador, and he voted in the United States for the first time in November. \u201cI feel lucky that I got it done,\u201d Mr. Reyes said of the changes to the test. He had had difficulty memorizing the names of the colonies, he said, and the new test requires applicants to name not three of the original 13 states, as he had managed to do, but five. Luz Gallegos, executive director of Todec, a nonprofit group that assists immigrants in Southern California, said her organization had seen a rush in immigrants applying to take the citizenship test, not only so they could vote in the November election, but because many hoped to avoid the new test. \u201cAs it is, it\u2019s difficult for them to memorize all the answers to the civics test,\u201d she said. Immigrants are not alone in finding the citizenship test, even in its previous form, challenging. About one in three Americans could pass a multiple-choice test consisting of items taken from that version, according to a 2018 national survey by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation. Most of the respondents did not know how many justices serve on the Supreme Court or which countries the United States fought in World War II. Citizenship tests have gone through various incarnations since being introduced around a century ago, replacing an earlier system, broadly criticized at the time, in which naturalization judges evaluated immigrants\u2019 knowledge of civics and the English language as they saw fit. \u201cThere was absolutely inconsistency and unfairness in the way that prospective citizens were examined by naturalization judges,\u201d said Jack Schneider, an assistant professor of education at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, noting that such hearings resulted in the rejection of large numbers of applicants. The test has changed considerably over time. Decades ago, the test asked how tall the Bunker Hill Monument is, missing, critics said, the more important issue of what it stands for. Another question, \u201cHow many stars are there on a quarter?\u201d was deleted after it was noted that the right answer depended on the quarter. The new citizenship test is one of a number of moves made under the Trump administration to not only halt unauthorized immigration but restrict legal immigration as well. The administration has made it harder for people to obtain asylum, increased the costs of applying for citizenship and, under the cloak of the coronavirus pandemic, suspended the issuance of green cards to immigrants seeking temporary work in the country. Taken together, these moves amount to a break from what historically had been bipartisan support for naturalization for immigrants who lived and worked in the United States and embraced the opportunity to become citizens. Applicants must already fill out a 20-page application, pass background checks, submit a bevy of documents and pass civics and English tests during an interview. The government moved this year to raise fees for naturalization from $725 to $1,170, or $1,160 if the application was filed online, but a federal judge in California blocked the increase in September. Organizations that offer citizenship classes to help immigrants study for the test are scrambling to revamp their lesson plans to respond to the new questions. Lynne Weintraub, who trains citizenship instructors and was involved in the design of the 2008 test, said the revisions were adopted without outside professional input that might have helped ensure that the test was a fair and valid measure of applicants\u2019 knowledge of civics. \u201cYou can\u2019t even imagine the turmoil that this has created,\u201d Ms. Weintraub said. The new test, she said, presents additional problems for many English language learners by clustering abstract concepts into one phrase in some questions, \u201cmaking them impossible for immigrants with low English proficiency and less education to follow.\u201d",

    "article_text": "El nuevo examen para la ciudadan\u00eda estadounidense es m\u00e1s largo y complicado El gobierno de Trump est\u00e1 implementando cambios radicales en el examen que los inmigrantes deben tomar para convertirse en ciudadanos de Estados Unidos, ahora se incluyen matices de filosof\u00eda conservadora que dificultan la prueba para las personas que est\u00e1n estudiando el idioma ingl\u00e9s. La nueva prueba de ciudadan\u00eda, que entr\u00f3 en vigor el martes, es m\u00e1s larga que antes y ahora se requiere que los solicitantes respondan correctamente 12 de 20 preguntas en vez de 6 de 10. Tambi\u00e9n es m\u00e1s compleja, elimina la geograf\u00eda simple y agrega docenas de posibles preguntas posibles, algunas con frases matizadas y complicadas que podr\u00edan hacer que los solicitantes se equivoquen si no las analizan detenidamente. De las 18 preguntas que se eliminaron de la prueba anterior, 11 ten\u00edan respuestas simples, a veces de una sola palabra. El nuevo examen agrega un obst\u00e1culo m\u00e1s para los inmigrantes que buscan convertirse en ciudadanos con derecho al voto, en los \u00faltimos d\u00edas de una gesti\u00f3n que ha impuesto nuevas barreras para la inmigraci\u00f3n y l\u00edmites para quienes ya est\u00e1n en el pa\u00eds y aspiran a la residencia legal para, eventualmente, naturalizarse. Un tema muy comentado es que se proporciona una nueva respuesta a la pregunta: \u201c\u00bfA qui\u00e9n representa un senador de Estados Unidos?\u201d. Antes la respuesta era \u201ca toda la gente del estado\u201d; en la nueva prueba, se especifica que representa a los \u201cciudadanos\u201d en el estado. Destaca una nueva pregunta sobre la D\u00e9cima Enmienda, que reserva a los estados todos los poderes que no se le otorgan espec\u00edficamente al gobierno federal, una de las secciones favoritas de la Carta de Derechos para los conservadores que cuestionan la autoridad federal. Otra pregunta nueva, \u201c\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 Estados Unidos se involucr\u00f3 en la guerra de Vietnam?\u201d, tiene una \u00fanica respuesta correcta: \u201cDetener la propagaci\u00f3n del comunismo\u201d. La prueba no aborda las intensas protestas o el enorme n\u00famero de muertos derivados de la guerra. Las organizaciones de inmigraci\u00f3n, incluidas algunas que han ayudado a miles de personas a completar sus solicitudes de naturalizaci\u00f3n durante la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, advierten que la nueva prueba podr\u00eda dificultar que los inmigrantes pobres de pa\u00edses no angloparlantes se conviertan en ciudadanos y, en \u00faltima instancia, reducir\u00eda el n\u00famero de inmigrantes que votan. Los cr\u00edticos tambi\u00e9n dijeron que el nuevo examen podr\u00eda generar m\u00e1s demoras en un sistema que ya est\u00e1 plagado de retrasos. \u201cEs el \u00faltimo esfuerzo de un gobierno que busca evitar que las personas cumplan su sue\u00f1o de convertirse en ciudadanos\u201d, dijo Eric Cohen, director ejecutivo del Centro de Recursos Legales para Inmigrantes en San Francisco, un grupo sin fines de lucro que ayuda a los residentes que solicitan la ciudadan\u00eda. \u201cNo existe una raz\u00f3n legal, ni una raz\u00f3n regulatoria para hacer esto\u201d, dijo Cohen, y se\u00f1al\u00f3 que la prueba de ciudadan\u00eda no hab\u00eda cambiado desde 2008. \u201cEllos decidieron por su cuenta que ten\u00edan que cambiarla por razones pol\u00edticas\u201d. Dan Hetlage, portavoz del Servicio de Ciudadan\u00eda e Inmigraci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos (USCIS, por su sigla en ingl\u00e9s), la agencia que supervisa el proceso de naturalizaci\u00f3n, dijo en un comunicado que la prueba fue revisada \u201cpara garantizar que siga siendo un instrumento que eval\u00fae de manera integral el conocimiento de los solicitantes sobre la historia, el gobierno y los valores estadounidenses y apoya la asimilaci\u00f3n\u201d. El presidente electo Joseph R. Biden Jr. tiene la opci\u00f3n de revertir los cambios, aunque es probable que eso no ocurra, si es que llega a suceder, hasta que hayan transcurrido varios meses del pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o. La nueva prueba ser\u00e1 requerida para todas las personas que soliciten la ciudadan\u00eda despu\u00e9s del 1 de diciembre, aunque suele existir un lapso de varios meses entre el momento en que los candidatos solicitan y la fecha en que se programa la entrevista con un oficial del USCIS, lo que significa que es posible que algunos candidatos todav\u00eda presenten la prueba anterior. La tasa de aprobaci\u00f3n del actual examen de ciudadan\u00eda, seg\u00fan el USCIS, es del 91 por ciento. La Red Cat\u00f3lica de Inmigraci\u00f3n Legal hizo un an\u00e1lisis de la nueva prueba que concluy\u00f3 que 40 preguntas de las 100 originales permanecieron sin cambios con respecto a la versi\u00f3n anterior; el resto se reformul\u00f3 o se incluy\u00f3 por primera vez. Algunos inmigrantes ya han expresado su nerviosismo por los cambios en el examen. Nefi Reyes, un electricista salvadore\u00f1o que present\u00f3 la prueba anterior este a\u00f1o, aprob\u00f3 con una puntuaci\u00f3n perfecta. Hab\u00edan pasado 30 a\u00f1os desde que cruz\u00f3 la frontera hacia Estados Unidos para escapar de la guerra civil en El Salvador, y vot\u00f3 en Estados Unidos por primera vez en noviembre. \u201cMe siento afortunado de haberla presentado\u201d, dijo Reyes sobre los cambios en la prueba. Dijo que tuvo dificultades para memorizar los nombres de las colonias y el nuevo examen requiere que los solicitantes nombren cinco de los 13 estados originales, en cambio en la prueba que \u00e9l present\u00f3 solo le pidieron mencionar tres. Luz Gallegos, directora ejecutiva de Todec, un grupo sin fines de lucro dedicada a asistir a inmigrantes en el sur de California, dijo que su organizaci\u00f3n hab\u00eda visto un aluvi\u00f3n de personas que solicitaban tomar el examen de ciudadan\u00eda, no solo para poder votar en las elecciones de noviembre, sino porque muchos esperaban evitar la nueva prueba. \u201cTal como est\u00e1, es dif\u00edcil para ellos memorizar todas las respuestas de la parte de teor\u00eda c\u00edvica de la prueba\u201d, dijo. Los inmigrantes no son los \u00fanicos a quienes les parece desafiante la prueba de ciudadan\u00eda, incluso en su formulaci\u00f3n previa. Aproximadamente solo uno de cada tres estadounidenses podr\u00eda aprobar una prueba de opci\u00f3n m\u00faltiple que consta de elementos tomados de esa versi\u00f3n, seg\u00fan una encuesta nacional de 2018 realizada por la Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation. La mayor\u00eda de los encuestados no sab\u00eda cu\u00e1ntos jueces forman parte de la Corte Suprema o en qu\u00e9 pa\u00edses luch\u00f3 Estados Unidos en la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Las pruebas de ciudadan\u00eda han pasado por varias versiones desde que se introdujeron hace aproximadamente un siglo, remplazando un sistema anterior que fue ampliamente criticado porque los jueces de naturalizaci\u00f3n evaluaban el conocimiento de los inmigrantes sobre la educaci\u00f3n c\u00edvica y el idioma ingl\u00e9s como lo consideraban conveniente. \u201cHubo una absoluta inconsistencia e injusticia en la forma en que los jueces de naturalizaci\u00f3n examinaban a los posibles ciudadanos\u201d, dijo Jack Schneider, profesor asistente de educaci\u00f3n en la Universidad de Massachusetts, Lowell, y se\u00f1al\u00f3 que esas audiencias provocaron que un gran n\u00famero de solicitantes fuesen rechazados. La prueba ha cambiado considerablemente con el paso del tiempo. Hace d\u00e9cadas, el examen preguntaba la altura del Monumento Bunker Hill, sin mencionar qu\u00e9 es lo que representa, lo cual es, seg\u00fan algunos cr\u00edticos, el aspecto m\u00e1s importante. Tambi\u00e9n preguntaban \u201c\u00bfcu\u00e1ntas estrellas hay en una moneda de 25 centavos de d\u00f3lar?\u201d, pero se elimin\u00f3 cuando fue evidente que la respuesta correcta depend\u00eda de las diferentes presentaciones de la moneda. La nueva prueba de ciudadan\u00eda forma parte de una serie de medidas que fueron tomadas durante la gesti\u00f3n de Trump, no solo para detener la inmigraci\u00f3n no autorizada, sino tambi\u00e9n para restringir la inmigraci\u00f3n legal. El gobierno ha dificultado que las personas obtengan asilo, aument\u00f3 los costos de solicitar la ciudadan\u00eda y, bajo el manto de la pandemia del coronavirus, suspendi\u00f3 la emisi\u00f3n de tarjetas de residencia a los inmigrantes que buscan trabajo temporal en el pa\u00eds. Vistas en conjunto, estas medidas equivalen a una ruptura con lo que hist\u00f3ricamente ha sido el apoyo bipartidista a la naturalizaci\u00f3n para los inmigrantes que viven y trabajan en Estados Unidos y que aprovechan la oportunidad de convertirse en ciudadanos. Las personas deben completar una solicitud de 20 p\u00e1ginas, aprobar verificaciones de antecedentes, enviar una gran cantidad de documentos y aprobar ex\u00e1menes de educaci\u00f3n c\u00edvica e ingl\u00e9s durante una entrevista. El gobierno tom\u00f3 medidas este a\u00f1o para aumentar las tarifas de naturalizaci\u00f3n de 725 a 1170 d\u00f3lares, o 1160 si la solicitud se present\u00f3 en l\u00ednea, pero un juez federal de California bloque\u00f3 el aumento en septiembre. Las organizaciones que ofrecen clases de ciudadan\u00eda para ayudar a los inmigrantes a estudiar para el examen se esfuerzan por renovar sus contenidos con el fin de responder las nuevas preguntas. Lynne Weintraub, quien capacita a instructores de ciudadan\u00eda y particip\u00f3 en el dise\u00f1o de la prueba de 2008, dijo que los cambios se adoptaron sin aportes profesionales externos que podr\u00edan haber garantizado que el examen fuera una medida justa y v\u00e1lida del conocimiento c\u00edvico de los solicitantes. \u201cNi siquiera puedes imaginar la confusi\u00f3n que esto ha creado\u201d, dijo Weintraub. La nueva prueba, dijo, presenta problemas adicionales para muchos estudiantes del idioma ingl\u00e9s al agrupar conceptos abstractos en una sola frase \u201chaciendo que sea imposible de entender para los inmigrantes con bajo nivel educativo y poco dominio del ingl\u00e9s\u201d.

    "article_text": "Tenants Sue Trump Over Scheme That Drove Up Their Rents President Trump will face a raft of potential legal challenges when he leaves office \u2014 from, among others, the Manhattan district attorney, the New York attorney general and perhaps the United States Justice Department. Now add to that Leonie Green of the Westminster Apartments in Brooklyn. Ms. Green is among a group of tenants in rent-regulated apartments once owned by Mr. Trump\u2019s father who have filed a lawsuit against the president and his siblings, accusing the Trumps of a decade-long fraud to win artificially high rent increases through an invoice-padding scheme. The scheme, first revealed in a 2018 investigation by The New York Times, involved tacking at least 20 percent onto the cost of materials purchased for the apartments, with Mr. Trump, his siblings and a cousin splitting the extra proceeds. The maneuver generated millions of dollars for each sibling, with no work required. While the siblings were still liable for income taxes, the maneuver allowed them to evade far-higher gift and estate taxes on part of the fortune they received from their father. But the tenants paid a price. New York laws governing rent-regulated apartments allow owners to increase rents based on the costs of major capital improvements. The Trumps based their applications for rent hikes on the artificially increased invoices, so a boiler that actually cost $50,000 would generate a rent increase as if it had cost $60,000. The new lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, seeks the extra rent paid, plus interest and triple damages, for current and former tenants in more than 30 apartment complexes that belonged to the president\u2019s father, Fred C. Trump. The mostly austere red brick buildings \u2014 with names like Beach Haven, Shore Haven and Park Briar \u2014 are spread across Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. The invoice-padding scheme ran from 1992 until the Trumps sold their father\u2019s buildings in 2004, but the artificially increased rents remained in place. The lawsuit could pose a significant financial threat to Mr. Trump and his family. If the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers win approval of class-action status, any potential judgment would encompass every person who paid rent in more than 14,000 rent-regulated apartments since 1992. Ms. Green, 54, said she had moved into the Westminster Apartments, in the Ditmas Park neighborhood, 22 years ago. Paying the rent on her salary as an executive assistant has been a struggle, she said, and she has fought off several eviction actions after falling behind. She was shocked to learn that her difficulties might have been made worse by a rich family \u201cstealing from me.\u201d \u201cYou try so hard, and to hear something like this, it breaks my heart, because I believe they are just taking advantage of poor people,\u201d Ms. Green said. The lawsuit was filed just before midnight on Oct. 2, moments before the expiration of the two-year statute of limitations for any fraud discovered through The Times\u2019s 2018 investigation. An amended complaint was filed on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the Trump family described the lawsuit as \u201ccompletely frivolous.\u201d \u201cNot only are the allegations completely unsupported by any evidence, but they relate to events which go back nearly 30 years \u2014 yet were never once raised by anyone at any time only to be conveniently filed just one month before the 2020 presidential election,\u201d the spokeswoman, Kimberly Benza, said in a statement. Mr. Trump is already facing two New York investigations into his business activities and related tax issues \u2014 a criminal inquiry by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., and a civil one by the state attorney general, Letitia James. At least two significant civil lawsuits also remain active. The writer E. Jean Carroll claims that Mr. Trump defamed her in denying that he had raped her. And a class-action lawsuit asserts Mr. Trump\u2019s promotion of a company that promised people they could get rich selling video conference phones led them to lose money peddling an obsolete product. Mr. Trump could also face charges in matters not fully resolved during his presidency, including whether he obstructed justice in the Russia investigation or violated campaign finance laws in directing his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to make hush-money payments to two women who threatened to go public with their claims of past affairs with Mr. Trump. Jerrold S. Parker, a founding partner of Parker Waichman, a national law firm based in Port Washington, N.Y., said his firm began considering a legal remedy for the tenants after the article in The Times. The firm sought tenants this year through television and internet advertisements. The amended complaint lists 20 plaintiffs. \u201cA massive fraud spanning 28 years, victimizing several hundred thousand tenants in Trump regulated apartments, needed to be addressed,\u201d Mr. Parker said. The tenants, he said, \u201cmust be made whole as a result of the money that was unlawfully and unknowingly taken from them by the Trump family for their own personal gain.\u201d In addition to the president, the defendants in the lawsuit are his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a former federal judge, the estate of their brother Robert, who died this year, and the estate of John Walter, a favorite nephew and longtime employee of Fred Trump\u2019s. Mr. Walter died in 2018. The scheme began in 1992, after the Trumps realized that the family\u2019s aging patriarch was sitting on mountains of cash that could face a 55 percent estate tax. Part of the solution came with the creation of a business they named All County Building Supply & Maintenance, which had no offices or employees and listed its address at Mr. Walter\u2019s home on Long Island. Little changed in how goods were purchased for the buildings. Fred Trump, who died in 1999, or one of his executives continued to negotiate prices, but for each purchase, Mr. Walter would generate an invoice showing that All County had bought the items, and a second invoice marked up 20 to 50 percent showing what All County had billed to Fred Trump\u2019s properties. The siblings and Mr. Walter pocketed the difference. Former prosecutors told The Times that filing padded invoices with state rent regulators could have led to criminal charges at the time, but that the statute of limitations had long since expired. Mr. Trump\u2019s federal income tax records for some of those years, which were revealed in an investigation published by The Times this September, show that he received $1.38 million from All County during the four years ending in 2003. Thanks to losses on his own endeavors, he paid federal income taxes in only one of those years, a total of $39,117 in 2003. Ms. Barry filed a financial disclosure form for 1998 showing that she collected more than $1 million that year from All County. She retired last year as a federal appellate judge, ending an inquiry into complaints, spurred by The Times\u2019s investigation, that she had violated judicial conduct rules by participating in fraudulent tax maneuvers, including the invoice-padding scheme. The amended complaint filed this week notes that while Fred Trump\u2019s empire was sold nearly two decades ago, the Trumps only dissolved All County shortly after the Times article was published in 2018. One vendor from the All County years, Leon Eastmond, once told The Times that he was surprised when, after selling 60 boilers to Fred Trump, he opened his mail to find a $100,000 check from All County. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize the company,\u201d Mr. Eastmond said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know who the hell they were.\u201d",

    "article_text": "No, Barr was not part of a secret plot against President Trump. Not long after Attorney General William P. Barr said on Tuesday that the Justice Department had found no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election last month, the pro-Trump media world began circulating a falsehood about him. In this telling, Mr. Barr had been part of a plot by a secret cabal of elites against President Trump all along. The most prominent right-wing personality who spread the baseless narrative was the Fox Business host Lou Dobbs. In his nightly show monologue on Tuesday, Mr. Dobbs said that Mr. Barr must be \u201ceither a liar or a fool or both\u201d and suggested that he was \u201cperhaps compromised.\u201d Mr. Dobbs added that Mr. Barr \u201cappeared to join in with the radical Dems and the deep state and the resistance.\u201d Mr. Dobbs\u2019s unfounded accusation inspired dozens of Facebook posts and more than 14,000 likes and shares on the social network, as well as hundreds of posts on Twitter, over the past 24 hours, according to a New York Times analysis. Many of President Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters reacted virulently to Mr. Barr\u2019s comments on Tuesday because they dealt a blow to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the election. The comments were also jarring to some conservatives because Mr. Barr had been a longtime Trump loyalist. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. But one of Mr. Barr\u2019s former colleagues denied the attorney general was part of a secret plot against President Trump. George Terwilliger, who was Mr. Barr\u2019s deputy in the 1990s when Mr. Barr was attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, said Mr. Barr\u2019s intent in his Tuesday statement was \u201cjust to be responsible.\u201d When there are unfounded conspiracy theories about the Justice Department, Mr. Terwilliger said, \u201cit is responsible to say no, that did not happen.\u201d David Rohde, a New Yorker writer and former Times reporter who wrote the book \u201cIn Deep: The F.B.I., the C.I.A., and the Truth About America\u2019s Deep State,\u201d added that Mr. Barr could not be involved with a cabal of elites because \u201cin fact, there is no deep state plot.\u201d He said the term \u201cdeep state,\u201d which is shorthand for the conspiracy theory about Democratic elites secretly exercising political control over the public, has been co-opted and vulgarized by many in the pro-Trump universe. Mr. Dobbs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The far right\u2019s suspicions of Mr. Barr have been building for several days, partly because of comments made by President Trump. In a Fox News interview on Nov. 29, the president declared that the Justice Department was \u201cmissing in action\u201d in investigating allegations of widespread election fraud. \u201cYou would think if you\u2019re in the F.B.I. or Department of Justice, this is the biggest thing you could be looking at,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWhere are they? I\u2019ve not seen anything.\u201d \u201cThey just keep moving along and they go on to the next president,\u201d he added. That set the stage for mistrust in Mr. Barr. Even before Mr. Barr made his comments on Tuesday about not having found voter fraud, Emerald Robinson of Newsmax, the conservative cable network, tweeted that it was \u201cobvious now that Bill Barr came out of retirement to protect the DOJ/FBI from accountability for its role in Spygate.\u201d She was referring to the convoluted and unfounded conspiracy theory involving a Democratic plot to spy on Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. After Mr. Barr publicly acknowledged the election results, Mark Levin, a conservative radio host, said on Twitter and Facebook that it was \u201cmisleading\u201d and that \u201cthe DOJ has been very passive.\u201d The Gateway Pundit, the Right Scoop and The Washington Times, which are far right websites, also piled on. In various articles, the sites said: \u201cBarr\u2019s masquerade as someone opposed to the criminality of the Deep State\u201d was \u201ca venal lie,\u201d and claimed, without evidence, that the \u201cDOJ is reluctant to investigate election fraud.\u201d The articles reached up to 886,000 people on Facebook, according to the analysis by The Times.

    "article_text": "Here Are the Threats Terrorizing Election Workers WASHINGTON \u2014 In his urgent demand on Monday that President Trump condemn his angry supporters who are threatening workers and officials overseeing the 2020 vote, a Georgia elections official focused on an animated image of a hanging noose that had been sent to a young voting-machine technician. \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong,\u201d the official, Gabriel Sterling, a Republican, said at a news conference. \u201cI can\u2019t begin to explain the level of anger I have over this.\u201d But the technician in Georgia is not alone. Far from it. Across the nation, election officials and their staff have been bombarded in recent weeks with emails, telephone calls and letters brimming with menace and threats of violence, the result of their service in a presidential election in which the defeated candidate\u2019s most ardent followers have refused to accept the results. The noose may be approaching meme status among the recipients of the abuse. Amber McReynolds, the head of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonprofit organization that promotes voting by mail, said she had experienced a spike in online threats since Election Day, when Mr. Trump ratcheted up false claims that fraudulent mail votes had cost him the election. One serial harasser on Twitter, she said, has been especially venomous. \u201cHe sent me a picture of a noose and said, \u2018You\u2019re a traitor to the American people,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAll because I run a nonprofit that tries to make voting by mail easier and more secure.\u201d \u201cI personally have gotten 10 or 12 of those \u2014 emails with the nooses, images of people who have been hung,\u201d said the chief election official of one Western state, who refused to be named for fear of drawing even more threats. \u201cThey don\u2019t reference anything you\u2019re doing wrong. They\u2019re just, \u2018This election was stolen. We know you had something to do with it. We\u2019re going to come for you.\u2019\u201d That official, like some others, said the threats had been sent not just to high-ranking officials whose profiles have been raised by news media interviews, but to comparatively unknown members of their staffs. They are the poisonous fallout of an election in which Mr. Trump has stoked baseless claims of election fraud on a daily basis, his lawyers have peddled conspiracy theories and supporters have called for extralegal actions with the goal of keeping Mr. Trump in power. The president\u2019s own attorney general, William P. Barr, said on Tuesday that the Justice Department had found no evidence of fraud on a scale that could have overturned the results in an election that Mr. Trump lost in the Electoral College, 306 to 232, and by almost seven million votes. Officials in some states refused to confirm threats against their election workers, worrying that acknowledging them would only make the problem worse. But published reports of election-related threats and harassment have risen steadily in recent weeks. And in interviews, a number of state and local election officials have said that the volume of intimidating communications from outsiders \u2014 some of whom even identify themselves \u2014 was unprecedented. Among the targets, according to interviews and news reports, are officials in battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona, as well as election officers in less-contested states like Virginia, Vermont and Kentucky. In Philadelphia, an aide to a Republican city commissioner was bombarded with abuse shortly after the Nov. 3 vote after a Trump supporter, the former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, singled him out at a broadcast news conference. In Vermont, a caller left threatening voice mail messages on election officials\u2019 phones on Tuesday, including a call for them to face a firing squad. Although the calls were the first to be reported to law-enforcement authorities, the secretary of state, Jim Condos, said in a statement that \u201cthey are merely the extension of a pattern of vitriolic, often obscene, calls that our staff have had to endure during this election year.\u201d Arizona\u2019s Democratic secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, said last month that she and her family received \u201cutterly abhorrent\u201d death threats after Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the state\u2019s electoral votes. And in Phoenix, Adrian Fontes, who supervises elections across Maricopa County, said he and his staff had been threatened in \u201cplenty of instances\u201d in recent weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s just not right,\u201d said Mr. Fontes, a Democrat. \u201cAnd frankly, it\u2019s un-American.\u201d Not all the threats came from supporters of the president. In Michigan, The Detroit Free Press reported, the Republican chairwoman of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers was pelted with emails containing photos of dead women and threats against her daughter after she initially refused to certify the results of the election last month. But Mr. Trump and his supporters have unleashed an attack on the election results and procedures with few if any parallels in recent history. Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s recently pardoned former national security adviser, on Wednesday called on the president to declare martial law and order a new election overseen by the military. Joseph DiGenova, a former United States attorney who is a lawyer for the Trump campaign, was disavowed even by the White House after he said on Monday that Christopher Krebs, the federal cybersecurity official who deemed the November election the most secure in history, should be \u201ctaken out at dawn and shot.\u201d The language reflects the increasingly out-of-bounds rhetoric by some supporters of the president. Steve Bannon, the campaign strategist who briefly served as a Trump adviser, said last month that the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, perhaps the most trusted federal scientist on coronavirus issues, should be beheaded and their heads placed on pikes outside the White House. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Krebs hours after his assurance that the election had been secure. Mr. DiGenova later told The Washington Post that his comments were \u201chyperbole in political discourse.\u201d Mr. Krebs suggested on CNN that he would take legal action against Mr. DiGenova for the statement. The Trump campaign has responded to charges that it is fomenting violence with a muted denial. A campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, in response to Mr. Sterling\u2019s remarks, said on Tuesday that the campaign denounced violence and threats \u201cif that has happened.\u201d The campaign\u2019s primary focus, he said, was on documenting voter fraud. Mr. Trump has only doubled down on his fraud claims since Mr. Sterling, a voting systems manager in the office of Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia, warned that \u201csomeone\u2019s going to get killed\u201d if the incendiary rhetoric surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations did not abate. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump unleashed a 46-minute video full of wild accusations of fraud and tweeted: \u201cRigged Election. Show signatures and envelopes. Expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia.\u201d Excepting a handful of officials like Mr. Sterling and Mr. Raffensperger, prominent Republicans have said little or nothing about the violent threats that have terrorized election officers across the country. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has declined requests for comment on Mr. Sterling\u2019s statement. David J. Becker, the director of the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonpartisan group that seeks to improve election administration, said he knew of election officials and their families in a half-dozen states who had been forced to ask for police protection and even move out of their homes because of violent threats. \u201cThese threats are frightening,\u201d he said. \u201cThese threats often go into areas related to race or sex or anti-Semitism. More than once they specifically refer to gun violence.\u201d \u201cThese people are public servants,\u201d he added. \u201cDisturbing is not a word that comes close to what they are experiencing right now.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Sale of Arctic Refuge Oil and Gas Leases Is Set for Early January The Trump administration said Thursday that it would sell oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska in early January, further accelerating its last-ditch effort to allow drilling there. The Bureau of Land Management said the sale would take place on Jan. 6, following the publication next Monday of a notice of sale in the Federal Register. That notice requires a 30-day comment period before a sale can occur. The announcement of a sale date came just 16 days after the bureau released a \u201ccall for nominations,\u201d which allowed oil companies and others to detail which tracts of land in the refuge were of interest for drilling. Normally, a call for nominations allows at least 30 days for such responses, followed by weeks of analysis by the bureau to ultimately decide which tracts will be offered. That time frame would have pushed a sale to just a few days before, or beyond, the Jan. 20 inauguration of Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has opposed drilling in the refuge. The announcement, which came from the bureau\u2019s Alaska offices, did not mention why the timetable had been accelerated. But the Trump administration has made no secret of its desire to sell drilling rights in the refuge before leaving office. Environmental groups denounced the last-minute push. \u201cThis is a shameful attempt by Donald Trump to give one last handout to the fossil fuel industry on his way out the door, at the expense of our public lands and our climate,\u201d Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement. Once the sale is held, the bureau has to review and approve the leases, a process that typically takes months. But holding the sale on Jan. 6 potentially gives the bureau opportunity to finalize the leases before Inauguration Day. That would make it more difficult for the Biden administration to undo them. Environmental groups said they expected Mr. Biden to do just that. \u201cPresident Biden ran on, and was elected on, the most aggressive pro-climate platform of any successful candidate in history and he made protecting the Arctic refuge a day one priority,\u201d Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said in a statement. \u201cWe will need him to use all the tools at his disposal to stop the industrialization of this iconic national treasure.\" The plan to sell leases is also the subject of four lawsuits filed by environmental organizations, some Alaska Native groups and, in one case, a coalition of 15 states. The lawsuits contend that the Trump administration took shortcuts in the leasing process and that an environmental review was deeply flawed. The Arctic refuge is a vast expanse of virtually pristine wilderness, almost untouched by people and home to migrating caribou, polar bears and other wildlife. Of the refuge\u2019s 19 million acres, the lease sales would involve up to 1.5 million acres of the coastal plain of northeast Alaska. The environmental review, which was finalized earlier this year, recommended that almost all of the 1.5 million acres be offered for sale The refuge has long been protected by environmentalists and Congressional Democrats. But in 2017, with Republicans holding the White House and both houses of Congress, the plan to sell oil and gas leases in the coastal plain was approved as part of tax legislation. President Trump has said that opening part of the refuge to oil development was among the most significant of his efforts to expand domestic fossil fuel production. The coastal plain is believed to overlie one of the last remaining significant petroleum reserves in the United States, and could potentially yield billions of barrels of oil. But that assessment is decades old and relies largely on studies that used now-outdated technology to detect petroleum deposits underground. One exploratory well was drilled in the refuge in the 1980s, and a New York Times investigation found that the results were disappointing. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has praised the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to open the refuge to drilling, saying it would provide jobs and add to Alaska\u2019s revenue, which has been suffering as oil production on the North Slope has declined over the years. More recently, oil prices have sharply declined during the pandemic. Most of the state\u2019s political leaders support drilling in the refuge as well. Yet it is not clear how much interest the sale will attract from oil companies. Drilling in the Arctic is costly, making it harder to achieve a good return on investment, especially compared with drilling in places in the Lower 48 states, like Texas, which have less onerous conditions. Moreover, purchasing the leases would be only the beginning of the process. Most experts say it would be at least a decade or longer before any oil or gas was extracted from the refuge. By then, the drive to reduce worldwide fossil fuel use may mean there is little or no market for the oil. Companies may also decide that pursuing oil in such a pristine area, one that is prized by environmentalists around the country and by some Alaska Native groups, is not worth the potential effect on their reputations. Many major banks have said they will not lend money to companies for drilling in the refuge. In the 2017 legislation, the lease sale plan was billed as a means for raising revenue for the federal treasury. The Trump administration originally estimated a $1.8 billion windfall for the government over a decade. The Congressional Budget Office later offered a lower estimate of $1.1 billion. But independent analyses, including one by The New York Times, found that even that revised amount was likely overly optimistic. Based on similar sales in Alaska over the past several decades, the analyses found potential revenue over the next decade would likely be in the range of tens of millions of dollars",

    "article_text": "Trump Hints at Another Act in Four Years, Just Like Grover Cleveland WASHINGTON \u2014 On the day that President Grover Cleveland left the White House after losing his bid for re-election, his wife, Frances, told the staff to take care of the mansion. \u201cI want to find everything just as it is now when we come back again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are coming back just four years from today.\u201d And they did. Nearly 128 years after the Clevelands\u2019 triumphal comeback, President Trump is signaling that he may try to become only the second president in American history to win another term after being defeated. Even as he insists that he did not lose the 2020 election, Mr. Trump has been laying plans to run again in 2024 with a kickoff as early as this month or possibly on his successor\u2019s Inauguration Day. How serious he is remains to be seen. Many allies believe his talk of another run in 2024, when he will be 78 years old, is more about maintaining his relevance, enabling him to raise funds, soothing his wounded pride and trying to shed the label of loser. But even if it is only for show, Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of a 2024 race has already frozen the Republican field and could delay the emergence of a new generation of leaders while keeping the party tethered to the politically polarizing Mr. Trump for months or years to come. The outgoing president hinted at his ambitions to a crowd of Republican supporters at a White House Christmas party on Tuesday evening in his most overt semipublic comments since losing the Nov. 3 election that he refuses to concede. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing four years,\u201d he told guests in remarks posted online by a member of the Republican National Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I\u2019ll see you in four years.\u201d If so, it would be only the latest effort by Mr. Trump to defy history and do what few if any have done before. At least a half-dozen former presidents have sought to come back in the past, but none other than Cleveland succeeded, in some cases tarnishing their reputations in the losing effort. Typically, once voters reject a sitting president, they lose interest and move on to candidates perceived to have a greater chance of success. But Mr. Trump does not appear ready to voluntarily surrender the power and attention of the White House simply to retire to Mar-a-Lago to plan his presidential library. He has already raised $170 million since Election Day, much of it for a new political organization that can be used to pay for his political activities going forward. He has talked about creating a news media platform that could take on Fox News on the right and keep him part of the national conversation. And he will retain his Twitter bullhorn with 88.7 million followers allowing him to insert himself into any debate any time he likes, a powerful tool that no other defeated president has ever had. The president\u2019s flirtation with attempting a comeback has already complicated the plans for other Republicans who would like to step up, especially those who feel they owe some loyalty to him, like Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Nikki R. Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Trump retains fervent support among many Republicans despite his loss. A poll by Politico and Morning Consult last week found that 53 percent said they would vote for him in a Republican primary in 2024, with Mr. Pence at a distant 12 percent and Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, at 8 percent. Ms. Haley and others drew 4 percent or less. \u201cHe will be the prohibitive front-runner, especially if he can maintain media attention from Mar-a-Lago,\u201d said Alex Conant, a Republican political consultant. \u201cNobody is going to want to be the first candidate to announce they\u2019re running against him. Can you imagine the tweet storm that he\u2019ll launch against his first competitor? Any candidate that visits an early state next year will be overwhelmed with questions about their loyalty to Trump.\u201d But that could fade with time. With Mr. Trump not yet out of the Oval Office and loudly making false claims that the election was somehow stolen from him, he still commands the stage. But some Republicans argue that ultimately he cannot sustain the loyalty he now enjoys within the party given the stigma that comes with having lost the presidency and the exhaustion often expressed by many Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for a politician to dominate a party for each of the four years after he\u2019s president,\u201d said Michael J. Gerhardt, a constitutional scholar at the University of North Carolina who wrote about Cleveland and other one-term commanders in chief in \u201cThe Forgotten Presidents\u201d and testified last year before the House in favor of Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s happened a few times, but it\u2019s rare.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Trump faces potentially serious challenges after leaving office that may make another run implausible even aside from advancing age. Among other things, he has to find a way to repay or restructure $421 million in debt and he may have legal troubles stemming from multiple investigations at the federal, state and local levels. He has privately been discussing pre-emptively pardoning members of his family before leaving office, not usually a selling point for a future political campaign. The White House declined to discuss the president\u2019s thinking about 2024, citing his efforts to contest the 2020 results, which have been certified by all of the key battleground states and are on track to being settled by the Electoral College in less than two weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard any discussions of that,\u201d Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters who asked about a 2024 campaign on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the reporting, but the president\u2019s campaign is currently pursuing active litigation, and that is the focus, at least at the moment.\u201d Other presidents have sought to return to the White House without success. Martin Van Buren, who lost his bid for re-election in 1840, unsuccessfully sought his party\u2019s nomination in 1844 and then mounted a new campaign as a Free Soil candidate in 1848, but garnered only about 10 percent of the vote and won no states. Millard Fillmore, another 19th-century one-term president rejected by his own party, likewise tried the third-party route in staging a comeback campaign in 1856 as the nominee of the Know Nothings, winning 22 percent and just one state. A couple of presidents who left office voluntarily after two terms nonetheless changed their minds and sought to come back four years later without success. Ulysses S. Grant allowed his supporters to promote him for the Republican nomination in 1880, only to see the bid fizzle at the convention, while Theodore Roosevelt bolted his party and ran as head of the new Progressive or Bull Moose Party in 1912, succeeding only in taking down his handpicked Republican successor, William Howard Taft, and turning the White House over to the Democrats. Herbert Hoover, after being turned out in 1932, held out hope that the Republicans would anoint him as their nominee again in 1936 and 1940 only to be spurned. More recent defeated one-term presidents like Jimmy Carter and George Bush entertained no such fantasies, although Gerald R. Ford did briefly consider becoming a vice-presidential candidate four years after losing the White House. Cleveland is the only defeated president who ever moved back into the White House. A fiscally conservative Democrat, he won his first term in 1884 despite being accused of fathering a child out of wedlock, making him the nation\u2019s 22nd president. He became the only bachelor president to marry while in the White House when he wed Frances Folsom, who at 21 was 27 years younger than him. Even though he won the popular vote four years later, he lost the Electoral College to Benjamin Harrison, a Republican, over his support for lowering tariffs on foreign goods. Known for \u201can inherited strain of stubbornness that gleamed in his clear blue eyes before he was five years old,\u201d as Allan Nevins put it in his Pulitzer-winning biography, Cleveland refused to fade away and beat Harrison in 1892, fulfilling Frances\u2019s prediction and becoming the 24th president. One important difference between Cleveland and Mr. Trump is that Cleveland won the popular vote in all three presidential elections he ran in, while Mr. Trump lost the popular vote in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cGrover had the advantage of popular support that Trump lacks,\u201d said Matthew Algeo, the author of \u201cThe President Is a Sick Man\u201d about secret surgery Cleveland had while in office. There is little reason to think that Mr. Trump knows much about this history or even cares. Holed up in the White House, he is bruised by his election defeat, lashing out against those he blames, advancing fantasy conspiracy theories to explain it away and looking for a way to keep attention focused on himself. The prospect of running again is one way to do it, whether he goes through with it or not. And when he unhappily and involuntarily strides out of the White House for the last time in the next seven weeks, he can tell the staff to keep everything as it is now because he plans to be back.",

    "article_text": "How Is Trump\u2019s Lawyer Jenna Ellis \u2018Elite Strike Force\u2019 Material? Jenna Ellis broke into the legal profession in 2012 as a deputy district attorney in Weld County, Colo., a largely rural area that would soon make headlines for a failed attempt to secede from the rest of the state because some residents resented the growing dominance of more liberal communities to the south like Denver. Ms. Ellis prosecuted crimes like theft and assault, felonies of a different magnitude from the claims of sweeping fraud and criminal conspiracy she makes today as a top lawyer to President Trump. It wasn\u2019t long before she parlayed her law degree and experience as a prosecutor into jobs that thrust her beyond her corner of the state: She took a position with James Dobson, the evangelical heavyweight, joined the faculty at Colorado Christian University and started appearing on Denver radio as a legal commentator. By late 2018, regular viewers of cable news would come to know Ms. Ellis as a \u201cconstitutional law attorney\u201d \u2014 her preferred title \u2014 who aggressively came to Mr. Trump\u2019s defense as he faced investigation and impeachment. But a review of her professional history, as well as interviews with more than a half-dozen lawyers who have worked with her, show that Ms. Ellis, 36, is not the seasoned constitutional law expert she plays on TV. In many ways, that makes her ideal for the role she has now fashioned for herself: She is a star player in the president\u2019s theater of grievance and denial whose lack of relevant experience with the legal questions at hand has had no apparent bearing on her ability to present herself as someone of great authority. Since she graduated law school in 2011, nothing in her record in the courtroom \u2014 limited mostly to appearances in state court as a prosecutor or as counsel for clients charged with assault, prostitution, theft and domestic abuse \u2014 shows any time spent litigating election law cases. She holds herself out as an expert on the Constitution based on her self-published book and her teaching of pre-law classes to undergraduates. She has never appeared in federal district or circuit court, where most constitutional matters are considered, according to national databases of federal cases, and does not appear to have played a major role in any cases beyond her criminal and civil work in Colorado. On paper, the Trump campaign calls her a senior legal adviser. She has recently appeared alongside Rudolph W. Giuliani and other Trump lawyers \u2014 a group Ms. Ellis described as an \u201celite strike force team\u201d \u2014 at public hearings where she amplified the president\u2019s false claims of widespread voter fraud. Ms. Ellis\u2019s work appears to largely be in a public relations capacity. The Trump campaign and its supporters have so far filed about 50 election-related lawsuits. She has not signed her name or appeared in court to argue a single one. In a written statement responding to questions about her record, Ms. Ellis described herself as \u201ca highly experienced and highly qualified attorney and expert in my field.\u201d Any assertions to the contrary \u201ccast me in a false light,\u201d she said. The Trump campaign provided the name of one federal case in which it said Ms. Ellis had participated, in 2012, when she was a year out of law school. But her name is not among the lawyers listed in the decision, and the case was not heard in a regular federal court, but rather in an administrative tribunal. It has been a month since Election Day. In the weeks since, as Mr. Trump has refused to bow to the reality of his defeat, his fruitless attempts to persuade federal judges and state officials to undo the results have introduced the nation to a once-obscure cast of lawyers, legislators and local elections commissioners. Ms. Ellis is a natural in her newly prominent role. She has been front and center at several public sessions with Mr. Giuliani over the past week. Convened by pro-Trump Republican lawmakers, they serve no legal purpose and are essentially scaled-down political rallies for the president to vent his frustrations. At one last week in Pennsylvania and another on Monday in Arizona, the president called Ms. Ellis\u2019s cellphone and she held it near a microphone so the crowd could hear him speak. \u201cI find it astonishing that she\u2019s gotten to this point,\u201d said Stephanie Stout, a lawyer in private practice in Greeley, Colo., who worked with Ms. Ellis a few years ago defending a man who was accused of attempted murder. The partnership was short-lived, Ms. Stout said, because their client fired Ms. Ellis, deeming her not up to the job. \u201cShe just didn\u2019t have the legal chops,\u201d added Ms. Stout, who ultimately won the case on her own. \u201cAfter that, Jenna decided that I had stolen the case from her.\u201d The president\u2019s legal efforts to overturn the election have slowly petered out. Mr. Trump and his Republican supporters have already lost or withdrawn from nearly 40 lawsuits, leaving only a handful of cases still alive in courts across the country \u2014 and, of course, the very unlikely scenario that the Supreme Court will step in to save him. Lawyers who worked with Ms. Ellis said that she was not the kind of attorney they believed would be particularly helpful to this or any president in these endeavors, given her background. Craig Silverman, a lawyer in Denver who used to host a radio show on legal matters and current events that Ms. Ellis occasionally appeared on, described her as \u201can attorney of scant accomplishment.\u201d The cases she discussed with him, he recalled, were bread-and-butter criminal defense work. And he said he had always expected her to pursue a career in teaching and media \u2014 not the law. Then Mr. Silverman read the news last year that Mr. Trump had made her a senior legal adviser to his campaign. \u201cWhen I saw \u2018senior legal adviser,\u2019 it was like, \u2018Wow,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cTo have a title like that,\u201d he added, \u201cnobody knew her to be that type of lawyer.\u201d Though Mr. Silverman once considered himself friendly with Ms. Ellis, he said her insistence of widespread voter fraud had so unnerved him that he believed she might have violated Colorado\u2019s rules of professional conduct for lawyers, which prohibit making false statements. Ms. Ellis went to work for at least three private law firms in Northern Colorado after leaving the district attorney\u2019s office in 2013. Her professional biographies at the time cited her experience in landlord-tenant disputes and cases involving immigrants who accepted plea deals without being advised of the consequences. Some colleagues came away impressed. \u201cNo matter what anyone thinks of her, my experience was that she was a brilliant lawyer,\u201d said the founder of one of the firms, Brandon Marinoff. Mr. Marinoff said Ms. Ellis was with his firm for less than a year before moving on to a higher-paying job. In 2015 she joined Colorado Christian University as an affiliate faculty member and published her book, \u201cThe Legal Basis for a Moral Constitution: A Guide for Christians to Understand America\u2019s Constitutional Crisis,\u201d in which she lamented how the country had lost its way.  In other writings, she has reserved a particular disdain for the gay and transgender communities. In 2016, for instance, she referred to gay people on Facebook as \u201csinners\u201d whose \u201cconduct is vile and abominable.\u201d Colorado Christian does not have a law school or a program in constitutional law. Ms. Ellis taught pre-law and political science to undergraduates and was part of the team that developed and advised a moot court program, according to a university spokesman. Eventually she was made an assistant professor of legal studies \u2014 but never a \u201cprofessor of constitutional law,\u201d which is how she identified herself in pieces for The Washington Examiner that she started writing in 2017. She left teaching in 2018 to become the director of the Dobson Policy Institute, a small outfit in the evangelical empire of Mr. Dobson, who founded the socially conservative, Colorado Springs-based group Focus on the Family.  Her affiliations with The Examiner and the Dobson name helped her branch out from local radio to Fox News, where she appears to have first caught the eye of the president. A graduate of the University of Richmond law school, Ms. Ellis did not have the Ivy League, white-shoe credentials that typically impress Mr. Trump. But she did have an attribute that can carry just as much weight in his eyes: the ability to go on television and deliver scathing attacks on his critics. Ms. Ellis beat the drum for the president on cable and wherever else she had a platform. She issued statements from the Dobson Policy Institute praising the administration\u2019s \u201cdedication to the rule of law\u201d as Mr. Trump fanned fears about a migrant caravan moving through Mexico.  Mr. Trump liked what he saw. In August 2018, he posted to his Twitter account a claim Ms. Ellis had made on Fox News about bias in the F.B.I. He formally brought her on board as a campaign adviser in November 2019. As part of a presidential campaign with such a diffuse power structure, Ms. Ellis did not have much responsibility beyond her media appearances. But aides said that she did reinforce some of Mr. Trump\u2019s instincts, such as when she urged him to use the National Guard more aggressively against demonstrators over the summer. She has also gone to battle for him on Twitter. She was widely condemned after she reacted to the news that Senator Kamala Harris of California would become Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s running mate by saying that Ms. Harris\u2019s voice \u201csounds like Marge Simpson.\u201d She even drew a response from the creators of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who made a short video in which Marge scolds Ms. Ellis, saying, \u201cI teach my children not to name call, Jenna.\u201d But those who know Ms. Ellis said they imagined that her willingness to say almost anything in the president\u2019s defense was what he found appealing about her. Mr. Silverman, the Denver lawyer who knew her from his radio show, said that as a former prosecutor himself, he found what Ms. Ellis had done with her law career outrageous, but that he could see her utility to a president who does not let facts get in his way.  \u201cShe will go all in,\u201d Mr. Silverman said, \u201cas she\u2019s proved.\u201d Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.",

Stephen Colbert Invites You to Guess Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night\u2019s highlights that lets you sleep \u2014 and lets us get paid to watch comedy. We\u2019re all stuck at home at the moment, so here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now. President Trump is reported to have discussed the possibility of granting pre-emptive pardons to three of his children, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. On \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Stephen Colbert made a \u201cfun criminal activity page\u201d out of it, inviting viewers to match the person in Trump\u2019s circle to his or her alleged malfeasance.  \u201cOn the left, you see all of the potential pardon-getters, and on the right, there\u2019s a list of crimes, like money laundering, tax evasion and snorting coke off the last living black rhino. You have to match the person to their crime, and there are no wrong answers.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not just Rudy and the kids. Several of the president\u2019s allies have begun a campaign to petition the West Wing in hopes of securing pardons. One White House source says, \u2018You won\u2019t believe the amount of calls, some insane, we\u2019ve gotten.\u2019 Oh, I believe you\u2019re getting a lot of calls. What I don\u2019t believe is that only some of them are insane.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT \u201cBut it does lead to one obvious question: What are they guilty of? For some of them, it\u2019s pretty easy. Jared Kushner has long been suspected of shady financial dealings. Plus he\u2019s obviously Slender Man.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT \u201cI don\u2019t believe Eric has violated any laws, but he\u2019s still grateful to get a pardon. [imitating Eric] \u2018This is the best Christmas gift that my dad has ever given me. Also, the only Christmas gift.\u2019\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT \u201cAw, guys, that is adorable. Trump is pardoning his kids and his house pets.\u201d \u2014 TREVOR NOAH \u201cAnd he\u2019s not even pardoning them for anything specific. Trump is just handing out pardons like they\u2019re gift cards: [as Trump] \u2018I figured I\u2019d let you pick your own crime, so enjoy. Do something crazy, you know? Live a little.\u2019\u201d \u2014 TREVOR NOAH \u201cOf course the big question now is, can Trump legally pardon himself? Because you see, no one knows for sure. But I actually want Trump to try it, just because it will be fun to see how he\u2019ll do it. He\u2019ll probably be in the mirror like, [as Trump] \u2018I hereby pardon you. No, I pardon, stop pointing at me. I\u2019m trying to pardon you. You\u2019re pardoned. You\u2019re so good-looking, but you\u2019re pardoned.\u2019\u201d \u2014 TREVOR NOAH \u201cIt\u2019s not a great look for your presidency when your biggest accomplishment is \u2018most family members pardoned.\u2019\u201d \u2014 JIMMY FALLON \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy, the last person who needed pardons for their whole family was Charles Manson.\u201d \u2014 JIMMY FALLON \u201cAccording to legal experts, Trump\u2019s children may need pardons due to potential conflicts of interest arising between their business dealings and conversations with their father.

    "article_text": "U.S. Tightens Visa Rules for Chinese Communist Party Members The Trump administration on Wednesday issued new rules to curtail travel to the United States by members of the Chinese Communist Party and their immediate families, a move certain to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries. The new policy, which took immediate effect, limits the maximum duration of travel visas for party members and their families to one month, according to a State Department spokesman.  That means the Chinese recipient must use the visa to enter the United States within one month of it being issued. Based on standard procedure, U.S. border officials would determine at the point of entry how long the visitor can stay. The officials could still permit a multi-month visit.  A visa also does not guarantee entry into the United States; it only allows for consideration of entry by U.S. border officials. Previously, party members, like other Chinese citizens, could obtain visitor visas for the United States that were valid for up to 10 years. Travel visas for party members will also be limited to a single entry rather than multiple entries as was possible before, according to two people familiar with the changes. The new measures do not affect party members\u2019 eligibility for other kinds of visas, such as immigration or employment. The State Department spokesman added that no current visas would be revoked as a result of the policy changes. The spokesman made his comments after The New York Times reported on the new limits. The new visa rules add to the conflict, now years long, between the two countries on trade, technology and much else. Coming in the twilight of the Trump administration and aimed squarely at China\u2019s ruling elite, the visa restrictions and the likely Chinese response will be yet another challenge to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is inheriting a U.S.-China relationship that is in its worst state since the normalization of diplomatic ties in 1979. While some might hope for a reset of relations from Mr. Biden, his views on China have hardened since he was vice president under President Barack Obama. Mr. Biden appears to be committed to leaving in place many of the tough measures taken by the Trump administration, including tariffs and restrictions on Chinese technology.  In a Tuesday interview, Mr. Biden said he would first consult with allies to craft a more comprehensive response to Chinese trade tactics. He has also said he would forcefully address China\u2019s human rights violations, including mass detentions in the western region of Xinjiang. Chinese officials have worried that Mr. Biden will be more effective than President Trump at leading a broad global pushback against China. In principle, the new visa policy could affect the travel of roughly 270 million people, according to U.S. government estimates based on a Communist Party membership of 92 million. In practice, it might be difficult to determine who, apart from high-level officials, belongs to the party. That could grant Mr. Biden flexibility in enforcing the new rules, though it would be hard to ignore travel to the United States by top Chinese officials and their family members. According to the people familiar with the new rules for travel visas, American officials can make a determination about someone\u2019s Communist Party status based on their visa application and interview, as well as officials\u2019 local understanding of party membership. That could mean that the policy disproportionately hits China\u2019s top government and business leaders rather than the millions of lower-level members who join the party to get a leg up in areas as varied as business and the arts. China\u2019s top leader, Xi Jinping, has reasserted the primacy of the party in many aspects of daily life.  The State Department spokesman called the move part of \u201congoing policy, regulatory, and law-enforcement action across the U.S. government to protect our nation from the C.C.P.\u2019s malign influence.\u201d \u201cFor decades we allowed the C.C.P. free and unfettered access to U.S. institutions and businesses while these same privileges were never extended freely to U.S. citizens in China,\u201d he added. The policy change is likely to prompt retaliation from Beijing, though travel between China and the United States has already been hugely limited by the coronavirus pandemic. In 2018, almost three million Chinese citizens traveled to the United States. A spokeswoman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, Hua Chunying, condemned the new rules during a news conference on Thursday. \u201cWe hope people in the United States will adopt a common rational view toward China and give up their hatred and abnormal mind-set toward the Communist Party,\u201d Ms. Hua said, according to Bloomberg News. The new rules could prove to be a first step in attempting to systematically track lower-level party members who visit the United States. People who attempt to conceal their party membership while applying for a visa could be exposing themselves to charges of visa fraud if later discovered.  Even so, the restrictions are more moderate than an outright ban on travel to the United States by party members, which Trump administration officials had discussed this summer. The Trump administration has sought to push back against what it says are interference operations by the party in the United States. This year the Justice Department charged eight people with carrying out a harassment campaign on Beijing\u2019s behalf aimed at Chinese political dissidents and fugitives. It also charged Chinese researchers studying in the United States with visa fraud, saying they misled the American government about their status as officers in China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army. Under Mr. Trump, the State Department has announced other visa restrictions on various categories of Chinese citizens. These include officials responsible for the mass internment and surveillance of Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region, people working in the United States for state-controlled Chinese news organizations and officials deemed to be responsible for the political crackdown in Hong Kong. In May, American officials said the government was canceling the visas of graduate- or higher-level students in the United States who had ties to certain Chinese military institutions. Chinese students make up the largest group of international students in the country. The United States and China agreed in 2014 to increase the longest duration of tourist and business visas issued to each other\u2019s citizens to 10 years from one year. The arrangement was reached during a visit to Beijing by Mr. Obama, in an era of warmer relations between the two nations. In announcing the new visa policy at the time, the White House touted the benefits to the American tourism industry and to trade and other commercial ties with China.

    "article_text": "Congress Will Press Ahead on Military Bill, Defying Trump\u2019s Veto Threat WASHINGTON \u2014 Leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress said on Wednesday that they would press ahead in advancing an annual military policy bill without adding a repeal demanded by President Trump of a legal shield for social media companies, defying his threat to veto the legislation over the unrelated issue. Republicans\u2019 determination to advance the measure over Mr. Trump\u2019s objections amounted to a rare refusal by his allies on Capitol Hill to accommodate the president\u2019s hard-line stance, which has threatened to imperil the bill that authorizes pay raises for American troops. And it raised the prospect of a possible veto showdown in the final weeks of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 on a popular measure that has not failed to pass in 60 years. \u201cI don\u2019t want it on this bill, because we can\u2019t have a bill if that language is on it,\u201d said Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, describing what he told the president about the legal liability provision. \u201cWe just had an honest disagreement, very friendly.\u201d Mr. Trump threatened in July to veto the legislation over a provision requiring the removal of Confederate leaders\u2019 names from military bases, a measure that drew broad bipartisan support and was included in both the House and Senate versions of the bill. But with his time in office winding down, the president has become increasingly fixated on the idea of using the popular, must-pass legislation to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which protects platforms like Facebook and YouTube from being sued over much of the content posted by their users, and how they choose to take that content down. The provision has attracted increasing criticism from both parties, but especially from Mr. Trump and his allies, who say tech companies have hid behind it while suppressing conservative views. The White House had quietly floated the idea that Mr. Trump might drop his objection to renaming military bases if lawmakers would go along on Section 230. The notion met with swift opposition from members of both parties. On Tuesday night, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to warn that he would veto the bill if it did not include the repeal. Lawmakers and aides had worked for days to resolve the dispute, with Democrats refusing to accept any change to Section 230 and Republicans quietly discussing potential compromises even as many privately conceded such a provision did not belong on the defense measure. By late Tuesday night, Republicans had reached a breaking point, concluding that they had no choice but to move the bill forward without it. It is not yet clear whether Mr. Trump will make good on his threat to veto the bill, and less clear still whether lawmakers could muster the two-thirds supermajority in both chambers to achieve what would be the first veto override of his presidency. But in an interview on Wednesday, Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, hinted that such an outcome was possible. \u201cLane No. 1, at this point, is the president comes to his senses,\u201d Mr. Smith said in an interview. \u201cLane No. 2 is we get as strong a vote as possible and we override.\u201d \u201cI think we get a two-thirds vote in the House and the Senate and we get it done,\u201d he added. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that the president \u201cis serious\u201d about the veto. \u201cThe president will always defend our military, ensure that we get adequate defense funding, as he\u2019s gotten $2.9 trillion so far,\u201d Ms. McEnany said, \u201cbut he is going to put the pressure on Congress to step up on this.\u201d At least one Republican, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who sits on the Armed Services Committee and opposed the base-renaming amendment, deriding it as \u201cwoke fundamentalism,\u201d said he would vote against the final bill. Using the abbreviation for the bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, Mr. Hawley wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe NDAA does NOT contain any reform to Section 230 but DOES contain Elizabeth Warren\u2019s social engineering amendment to unilaterally rename bases & war memorials w/ no public input or process.\u201d But Mr. Smith said that after initially digging in over the base-renaming language amid a national outcry for racial justice, Mr. Trump appeared to have lost interest in the issue. \u201cHe got distracted, and the basic strength of the other side of the argument won the day,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s also possible that the president and the people around him realized this was not a fight that they wanted to have.\u201d On no other issue have Republicans been as willing to challenge Mr. Trump as on national security, expressing rare public disapproval over his attempts to end interminable conflicts overseas and his cozy relationship with dictators in violation of human rights abuses. In defying Mr. Trump on the military policy measure, Republican leaders also may have their eyes on a pair of runoffs in Georgia that will determine which party controls the Senate. The state is home to a dozen military installations populated by personnel who would be denied a pay raise and improvements to military housing if the military bill were derailed. The protections provided by Section 230 have allowed Silicon Valley\u2019s giants to grow rapidly. But the companies\u2019 critics say the law gave them a free pass from policing content like explicit images of children and videos produced by terrorist groups. That criticism is bipartisan: President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has called for the protections to be \u201crevoked.\u201d Over the course of negotiations, Republicans in the Senate suggested a wide range of changes to Section 230, none of which interested House Democrats, said multiple people familiar with the matter. One proposal was to attach language, championed by Republican lawmakers who believe social media platforms are slanted against conservatives, that would narrow the liability shield. They also floated language drafted by the Justice Department to limit the protections. Republicans also proposed adding more moderate language from a bipartisan bill that would require platforms to quickly take down content in response to court orders, said two people familiar with the matter. Senator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who is an author of that proposal, said in a Tuesday night tweet that the idea that Section 230 should be \u201crepealed, with no hearing, in the defense bill, is goofy.\u201d Many in the president\u2019s own party privately agreed with Mr. Schatz\u2019s assessment. When senior Republican lawmakers were first told of Mr. Trump\u2019s demand, some initially responded by laughing out loud, according to officials familiar with the discussions.

    "article_text": "Trump Hints at Another Act in Four Years, Just Like Grover Cleveland WASHINGTON \u2014 On the day that President Grover Cleveland left the White House after losing his bid for re-election, his wife, Frances, told the staff to take care of the mansion. \u201cI want to find everything just as it is now when we come back again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are coming back just four years from today.\u201d And they did. Nearly 128 years after the Clevelands\u2019 triumphal comeback, President Trump is signaling that he may try to become only the second president in American history to win another term after being defeated. Even as he insists that he did not lose the 2020 election, Mr. Trump has been laying plans to run again in 2024 with a kickoff as early as this month or possibly on his successor\u2019s Inauguration Day. How serious he is remains to be seen. Many allies believe his talk of another run in 2024, when he will be 78 years old, is more about maintaining his relevance, enabling him to raise funds, soothing his wounded pride and trying to shed the label of loser. But even if it is only for show, Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of a 2024 race has already frozen the Republican field and could delay the emergence of a new generation of leaders while keeping the party tethered to the politically polarizing Mr. Trump for months or years to come. The outgoing president hinted at his ambitions to a crowd of Republican supporters at a White House Christmas party on Tuesday evening in his most overt semipublic comments since losing the Nov. 3 election that he refuses to concede. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing four years,\u201d he told guests in remarks posted online by a member of the Republican National Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I\u2019ll see you in four years.\u201d If so, it would be only the latest effort by Mr. Trump to defy history and do what few if any have done before. At least a half-dozen former presidents have sought to come back in the past, but none other than Cleveland succeeded, in some cases tarnishing their reputations in the losing effort. Typically, once voters reject a sitting president, they lose interest and move on to candidates perceived to have a greater chance of success. But Mr. Trump does not appear ready to voluntarily surrender the power and attention of the White House simply to retire to Mar-a-Lago to plan his presidential library. He has already raised $170 million since Election Day, much of it for a new political organization that can be used to pay for his political activities going forward. He has talked about creating a news media platform that could take on Fox News on the right and keep him part of the national conversation. And he will retain his Twitter bullhorn with 88.7 million followers allowing him to insert himself into any debate any time he likes, a powerful tool that no other defeated president has ever had. The president\u2019s flirtation with attempting a comeback has already complicated the plans for other Republicans who would like to step up, especially those who feel they owe some loyalty to him, like Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Nikki R. Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Trump retains fervent support among many Republicans despite his loss. A poll by Politico and Morning Consult last week found that 53 percent said they would vote for him in a Republican primary in 2024, with Mr. Pence at a distant 12 percent and Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, at 8 percent. Ms. Haley and others drew 4 percent or less. \u201cHe will be the prohibitive front-runner, especially if he can maintain media attention from Mar-a-Lago,\u201d said Alex Conant, a Republican political consultant. \u201cNobody is going to want to be the first candidate to announce they\u2019re running against him. Can you imagine the tweet storm that he\u2019ll launch against his first competitor? Any candidate that visits an early state next year will be overwhelmed with questions about their loyalty to Trump.\u201d But that could fade with time. With Mr. Trump not yet out of the Oval Office and loudly making false claims that the election was somehow stolen from him, he still commands the stage. But some Republicans argue that ultimately he cannot sustain the loyalty he now enjoys within the party given the stigma that comes with having lost the presidency and the exhaustion often expressed by many Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for a politician to dominate a party for each of the four years after he\u2019s president,\u201d said Michael J. Gerhardt, a constitutional scholar at the University of North Carolina who wrote about Cleveland and other one-term commanders in chief in \u201cThe Forgotten Presidents\u201d and testified last year before the House in favor of Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s happened a few times, but it\u2019s rare.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Trump faces potentially serious challenges after leaving office that may make another run implausible even aside from advancing age. Among other things, he has to find a way to repay or restructure $421 million in debt and he may have legal troubles stemming from multiple investigations at the federal, state and local levels. He has privately been discussing pre-emptively pardoning members of his family before leaving office, not usually a selling point for a future political campaign. The White House declined to discuss the president\u2019s thinking about 2024, citing his efforts to contest the 2020 results, which have been certified by all of the key battleground states and are on track to being settled by the Electoral College in less than two weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard any discussions of that,\u201d Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters who asked about a 2024 campaign on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the reporting, but the president\u2019s campaign is currently pursuing active litigation, and that is the focus, at least at the moment.\u201d Other presidents have sought to return to the White House without success. Martin Van Buren, who lost his bid for re-election in 1840, unsuccessfully sought his party\u2019s nomination in 1844 and then mounted a new campaign as a Free Soil candidate in 1848, but garnered only about 10 percent of the vote and won no states. Millard Fillmore, another 19th-century one-term president rejected by his own party, likewise tried the third-party route in staging a comeback campaign in 1856 as the nominee of the Know Nothings, winning 22 percent and just one state. A couple of presidents who left office voluntarily after two terms nonetheless changed their minds and sought to come back four years later without success. Ulysses S. Grant allowed his supporters to promote him for the Republican nomination in 1880, only to see the bid fizzle at the convention, while Theodore Roosevelt bolted his party and ran as head of the new Progressive or Bull Moose Party in 1912, succeeding only in taking down his handpicked Republican successor, William Howard Taft, and turning the White House over to the Democrats. Herbert Hoover, after being turned out in 1932, held out hope that the Republicans would anoint him as their nominee again in 1936 and 1940 only to be spurned. More recent defeated one-term presidents like Jimmy Carter and George Bush entertained no such fantasies, although Gerald R. Ford did briefly consider becoming a vice-presidential candidate four years after losing the White House. Cleveland is the only defeated president who ever moved back into the White House. A fiscally conservative Democrat, he won his first term in 1884 despite being accused of fathering a child out of wedlock, making him the nation\u2019s 22nd president. He became the only bachelor president to marry while in the White House when he wed Frances Folsom, who at 21 was 27 years younger than him. Even though he won the popular vote four years later, he lost the Electoral College to Benjamin Harrison, a Republican, over his support for lowering tariffs on foreign goods. Known for \u201can inherited strain of stubbornness that gleamed in his clear blue eyes before he was five years old,\u201d as Allan Nevins put it in his Pulitzer-winning biography, Cleveland refused to fade away and beat Harrison in 1892, fulfilling Frances\u2019s prediction and becoming the 24th president. One important difference between Cleveland and Mr. Trump is that Cleveland won the popular vote in all three presidential elections he ran in, while Mr. Trump lost the popular vote in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cGrover had the advantage of popular support that Trump lacks,\u201d said Matthew Algeo, the author of \u201cThe President Is a Sick Man\u201d about secret surgery Cleveland had while in office. There is little reason to think that Mr. Trump knows much about this history or even cares. Holed up in the White House, he is bruised by his election defeat, lashing out against those he blames, advancing fantasy conspiracy theories to explain it away and looking for a way to keep attention focused on himself. The prospect of running again is one way to do it, whether he goes through with it or not. And when he unhappily and involuntarily strides out of the White House for the last time in the next seven weeks, he can tell the staff to keep everything as it is now because he plans to be back.",

    "article_text": "A day after Justice Dept. found no evidence of widespread election fraud, Trump posts video filled with falsehoods. Increasingly isolated in the White House, President Trump on Wednesday released a 46-minute videotaped speech filled with lies in which he spoke angrily about a \u201crigged\u201d election even though his own attorney general and election officials across the country have attested to his loss. Mr. Trump posted a short, two-minute version of the speech on Twitter, recorded in the Diplomatic Room of the White House and delivered behind a lectern bearing the presidential seal, with a link to the full version on his Facebook page. Saying that his remarks \u201cmay be the most important speech I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d the president once again refused to concede defeat in his bid for re-election almost one month after Election Day. Instead, he repeated a long series of false assertions about voter fraud, accusing Democrats of a conspiracy to steal the presidency. Twitter quickly labeled the post as \u201cdisputed.\u201d Facebook added a note that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who received almost 81 million votes and 306 electoral votes, is the projected winner of the election. The video, which a White House official said was recorded last week, was the in-person embodiment of Mr. Trump\u2019s staccato tweets during the past three weeks: one falsehood after another about voting irregularities in swing states, Democratic conspiracies, attacks on state officials and signature verifications. The president\u2019s rambling assertions in the video were drastically undercut on Tuesday, when Attorney General William P. Barr told The Associated Press that despite inquiries by the Justice Department and the F.B.I., \u201cto date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d Mr. Trump continued to rage about voting irregularities in the video, a day after a Republican elections official in Georgia lashed out at him, saying the president was inspiring violence and was to blame for a wave of death threats. \u201cMr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language,\u201d said Gabriel Sterling, a voting systems manager in Georgia. \u201cStop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence.\u201d At the end of the video, Mr. Trump improbably described himself as the defender of America\u2019s election system, saying he had been told that the single most important accomplishment of his presidency would be protecting the integrity of the voting system. It was unclear why Mr. Trump waited until Wednesday to release the video. But he made it public after a series of rebukes by members of his own party who have increasingly abandoned him as he clings to power by making baseless assertions about voter fraud that have been roundly rejected. The president\u2019s legal team, led by his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, has lost dozens of lawsuits in courts across the country while making wild allegations without any proof to back them up. Some of the president\u2019s key Republican allies on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have urged him to move on in recent days. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, referred this week to the \u201cnew administration\u201d that would be taking over next year, a clear signal to Mr. Trump that his time in office was coming to an end. Lawmakers in both parties have also signaled that they may be willing to defy his threat to veto the military spending bill unless Congress eliminates a legal provision that provides liability protection for social media companies. Those social media platforms remain the president\u2019s favorite method for disseminating false and misleading information. Within a few hours, his tweet had been \u201cliked\u201d by almost 134,000 Twitter users, and his Facebook video had been shared 93,000 times.",

    "article_text": "A Trump Fund-Raiser for Maya Wiley? Yes, but It\u2019s Mary Trump Mary L. Trump has had a busy year: writing a best-selling memoir about her family, suing for her inheritance and trying to prevent her uncle from winning a second term as president. Now she has turned her attention to the New York City mayor\u2019s race. Ms. Trump will host an online fund-raiser on Tuesday for Maya Wiley, the former MSNBC analyst and counsel for Mayor Bill de Blasio. Ms. Wiley is one of at least 10 Democratic candidates running for mayor next year, creating a mad scramble to raise money before the June 22 primary. The friendship between Ms. Wiley and Ms. Trump, both liberal favorites with hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers, goes back to at least August, when Ms. Trump expressed support for Ms. Wiley in a tweet: \u201cI truly hope you are NYC\u2019s next mayor,\u201d she wrote. In late October, Ms. Trump held an online event to highlight President Trump\u2019s failures and invited Ms. Wiley, along with other guests like Patti LuPone, the Broadway star. Ms. Trump and Ms. Wiley both supported President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. Ms. Trump said in an interview that she had seen Ms. Wiley on MSNBC and was impressed. After her event, Ms. Trump asked how she could help with her mayoral bid. \u201cI think what I said was, \u2018I\u2019ll do whatever you need me to do,\u2019\u201d Ms. Trump said. Ms. Trump, a clinical psychologist who announced her second book on \u201cAmerica\u2019s national trauma\u201d this week, said she was drawn to the historic nature of Ms. Wiley\u2019s candidacy as a Black woman \u2014 New York has never had a female mayor \u2014 and her message of not just rebuilding the city after the pandemic, but reimagining it. \u201cAt the heart of that is grappling with inequality and racial inequality,\u201d Ms. Trump said. \u201cBecause of the way she talks about the issues and her grasp of them, I think she\u2019s the person to do the best job.\u201d While New Yorkers flocked to the polls in November to vote against Mr. Trump, it is unclear how much, if at all, his presidency remains an issue in the mayor\u2019s race. Ester Fuchs, a politics professor at Columbia University, said that Mr. Trump was unlikely to be a major factor in the primary because all of the Democratic candidates strongly opposed him, but that he could increase voter participation. \u201cIt\u2019s still so traumatic for New Yorkers,\u201d she said of the Trump presidency, \u201cthat it will help with civic engagement and turnout in the mayoral race.\u201d As the city faces a troubling second wave of the coronavirus, nearly all of the candidates have moved to online fund-raisers. While the prospect of another video call might seem like a chore, a celebrity host can create a little excitement. Ms. Wiley has scheduled online events with other prominent hosts, including Gloria Steinem, the feminist icon; Tom Colicchio, the celebrity chef; and V, the writer formerly known as Eve Ensler. But at least one candidate, Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, is holding in-person fund-raisers. Mr. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, was captured dining with donors at an Upper West Side restaurant by The Daily News. Democratic leaders in Brooklyn also faced a backlash after they were photographed mingling without face masks at a recent birthday party that Mr. Adams briefly attended. His mayoral campaign said it had strict protocols to make sure his events were safe. \u201cEric believes that all campaigns should follow the law and public health standards to prevent the spread of Covid-19 \u2014 and that is what the campaign has done,\u201d his spokesman, Evan Thies, said. \u201cIf the state decides it is no longer safe for New Yorkers to frequent small businesses, the campaign will, of course, follow that rule as well.\u201d Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat in his second term, stopped short of saying in-person fund-raisers should be banned, but he urged candidates to exhibit caution. \u201cThey have to be really, really careful and show people that they\u2019re following the rules,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. Ms. Wiley is holding a flood of online fund-raisers hosted by a range of Black scholars and liberal donors, including Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, a prominent professor at Columbia Law School; Gara LaMarche, the president of Democracy Alliance, a group of major liberal donors; Zachary Carter, the former corporation counsel for Mayor de Blasio; and Coraminita Mahr, a vice president of the powerful 1199 SEIU union. Ms. Wiley\u2019s greatest liability to voters may be the time she spent working for Mr. de Blasio, whose popularity has steadily diminished since he was first elected in 2013. She has sought to distance herself from him. Ms. Trump, who lives on Long Island but grew up in New York City, understood Ms. Wiley\u2019s predicament. Asked about the mayor\u2019s weaknesses, she joked: \u201cHow much time do you have?\u201d and then scoffed at his failed presidential bid. Ms. Trump said Mr. de Blasio seemed like someone who did not know how to grapple with issues on the ground. \u201cI think Maya is a really grounded person who understands that we can\u2019t just spout platitudes,\u201d Ms. Trump said. \u201cWe have to do the work. That reason alone would make her a better mayor than de Blasio.\u201d The race has been reshaped by the pandemic as candidates try to prove who is best qualified to lead the city out of economic crisis. One such candidate is Raymond McGuire, a vice chairman at Citigroup, who quickly raised more than $2 million after entering the race in October. Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, has cast himself as the most proven fiscal leader among the candidates, saying that he would \u201cmanage the hell out of this city.\u201d He has also focused on securing endorsements from progressive leaders, including Jimmy Van Bramer, the City Council member who helped defeat the deal for an Amazon headquarters in Queens. Mr. Stringer has a few celebrity backers of his own, including a $2,000 donation in June from Cynthia Germanotta, Lady Gaga\u2019s mother, and an online fund-raiser this week by Danny Strong, a Hollywood producer, with tickets ranging from $25 to $250. Mr. Stringer, whose mother died from the virus in April, is holding only online fund-raisers. \u201cThe last time Comptroller Stringer held an indoor fund-raiser was in early March, before the quarantine period began, and will not do so again until it\u2019s safe,\u201d said Cameron Hellerman, a spokesman for his campaign. Mr. Adams announced two of his own endorsements on Tuesday: Roxanne J. Persaud, a state senator, and Jaime R. Williams, a state assemblywoman, both women of color from Brooklyn. When Mr. Adams\u2019s deputy was photographed at an indoor birthday party last month without a mask, Mr. Adams said publicly that he accepted her apology. But he failed to mention that he also attended the party. \u201cEric arrived at the party late, saw there was about 10 or 12 people there, said a quick happy birthday and left,\u201d his spokesman said.",

    "article_text": "Can Trump Pre-emptively Pardon Allies or Himself? Clemency Power, Explained WASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump enters the endgame of his time in power, he is said to have consulted advisers about the possibility of granting pre-emptive pardons to his relatives and to allies like his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Trump has also claimed that he has \u201cthe absolute right to pardon myself,\u201d raising the possibility that he may try to impose roadblocks against any future federal prosecution of himself. And a federal judge this week unsealed heavily redacted documents revealing that the F.B.I. has been investigating an unidentified person for a potential pardon-for-bribe scheme. The rising chatter about pardon issues follows closely on the heels of Mr. Trump\u2019s pardon last week of his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn and has heightened interest in the scope and limits of his clemency power. Here is what you need to know. It is an executive power that acts as a check and balance on the federal criminal justice system, enabling a president to bestow mercy upon offenders. The Constitution gives the president clemency powers \u201cto grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\u201d This could be either a commutation, which reduces or eliminates a sentence imposed after a conviction for a crime, or a pardon \u2014 a broader nullification of all legal consequences for an offense. Yes. In Ex parte Garland, an 1866 case involving a former Confederate senator who had been pardoned by President Andrew Johnson, the Supreme Court said the pardon power \u201cextends to every offense known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.\u201d It is unusual for a president to issue a prospective pardon before any charges are filed, but there are examples, perhaps most famously President Gerald R. Ford\u2019s pardon in 1974 of Richard M. Nixon to prevent him from being prosecuted after the Watergate scandal. And in 1977, on his first day in office, President Jimmy Carter pardoned hundreds of thousands of men who had dodged the draft during the Vietnam War, enabling many who had fled to Canada to return home without fear of prosecution. No. For one thing, Mr. Trump only has clemency power over federal offenses. Some types of offense \u2014 like tax evasion and financial fraud \u2014 are offenses under both federal and state law. Mr. Trump does not have the authority to prevent state prosecutors from pursuing charges over such a matter. State prosecutors in New York are investigating various matters related to Mr. Trump\u2019s financial dealings. Moreover, a pardon could increase one type of risk: When a pardon eliminates the possibility that the recipient might be prosecuted for a purely federal crime, it also eliminates the ability of that person to invoke the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in order to avoid testifying about it. Thus, pardon recipients subpoenaed before Congress or a grand jury would be compelled to talk; if they lied or refused to testify, that would be a new crime. Yes. The Constitution does not bar pardons that raise the appearance of self-interest or a conflict of interest, even if they may provoke a political backlash and public shaming. Shortly before leaving office in 1993, President George Bush pardoned six Reagan administration officials over \u201ctheir conduct related to the Iran-contra affair,\u201d including Caspar W. Weinberger, the former defense secretary who was about to go to trial on charges that he had lied to Congress. The independent prosecutor, Lawrence E. Walsh, had been planning in the trial to explore whether Bush had played a greater role than he had acknowledged when he was the vice president, and Mr. Walsh accused Bush of a \u201ccover-up.\u201d In 2001, shortly before leaving office, President Bill Clinton issued several controversial pardons, including to his half brother, Roger Clinton, over a 1985 cocaine conviction for which he had served about a year in prison, and to Susan H. McDougal, a onetime Clinton business partner who had been jailed as part of the Whitewater investigation. This is unclear. Usually, pardons are written in a way that specifically describes which crimes or sets of activities they apply to. There is little precedent laying out the degree to which a pardon can be used to instead foreclose criminal liability for anything and everything. Notably, Ford\u2019s \u201cfull, free and absolute pardon\u201d of Nixon was extraordinarily broad. It covered all federal crimes Nixon \u201ccommitted or may have committed\u201d during his presidency, rather than listing particular matters or categories of activities. But because prosecutors did not try to charge Nixon, the validity of this rare, open-ended clemency was untested. In a law journal article this year, Aaron Rappaport, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings, argued that pardons must be specific about what they are covering. He cited English common-law principles that informed the founders\u2019 understanding of pardons, as well as fundamental democratic values. Still, he also acknowledged that \u201cthe existence of a specificity requirement has never been acknowledged by the Supreme Court.\u201d This is unclear. There is no definitive answer because no president has ever tried to pardon himself and then faced prosecution anyway. As a result, there has never been a case that gave the Supreme Court a chance to resolve the question. In the absence of any controlling precedent, legal thinkers are divided about the matter. Those who believe a president can pardon himself point out that the relevant text in the Constitution is broadly written and contains no explicit exception precluding a self-dealing use or abuse of that power. Because the founders did make an explicit exception for cases of impeachment, they argued, that implies they did not intend there to be any other exceptions. But other legal thinkers have come up with theories for why the Supreme Court might nevertheless reject a purported self-pardon if it ever came up. For example, some scholars have argued that the founders\u2019 use of the word \u201cgrant\u201d should be interpreted as meaning one person giving something to another, so a president cannot grant a pardon to himself. In August 1974, four days before Nixon resigned, Mary C. Lawton, then the acting head of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, issued a terse legal opinion stating that \u201cit would seem\u201d that he could not pardon himself \u201cunder the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.\u201d But she did not explain what transformed that principle into an unwritten legal limit on the power the Constitution bestows on presidents. Yes. He could get Vice President Mike Pence to do it for him, using the 25th Amendment. This part of the Constitution provides a mechanism for temporarily making the vice president the \u201cacting president\u201d when a president is disabled from carrying out his duties. In 2002 and 2007, for example, when President George W. Bush was preparing to be sedated for colonoscopies, he briefly handed the powers of the presidency to Vice President Dick Cheney. In her 1974 memo, Ms. Lawton argued that it would be lawful for a president to declare himself temporarily disabled, receive a pardon from the vice president and then resume his role as president. Probably. The Constitution does not create any explicit exception that invalidates pardons that were granted under dubious circumstances \u2014 like if a president took money in exchange, or was buying the silence of a witness to his own wrongdoing. Grants of clemency are widely understood to be irrevocable. Still, a president who grants a pardon under corrupt circumstances could open himself up to prosecution for acts like bribery or obstruction of justice after he leaves office. Even Attorney General William P. Barr, who embraces a maximalist ideology of executive power, testified during his confirmation hearing that if a president pardoned someone in exchange for a promise not to incriminate him, \u201cthat would be a crime.\u201d",

Brad Parscale, the former Trump campaign manager who was demoted in July, claimed in a Fox News interview on Tuesday night that President Trump would have handily won the election if he had expressed more empathy about the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe lost suburban families,\u201d Mr. Parscale said. \u201cI think that goes to one thing: the decision on Covid to go for opening the economy versus public empathy.\u201d He added, \u201cI think if he had been publicly empathetic, he would have won.\u201d Mr. Parscale also appeared to blame those who succeeded him in running Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign for failing to file lawsuits before Election Day. In fact, the campaign filed multiple lawsuits during the early voting period seeking to block mail-in ballot rule changes. \u201cI wanted lawyers everywhere,\u201d Mr. Parscale said. \u201cWhy, during the early voting days, why weren\u2019t they already getting in there and filing lawsuits? Why are we doing it post?\u201d At other points in the interview, Mr. Parscale refused to concede that the president had lost the election, claiming that Mr. Trump was \u201cin a position that he might be able to pull this off.\u201d  Mr. Parscale has kept a low profile since September, when he was hospitalized after his wife, Candice, called the police saying he was in his house with guns and threatening to hurt himself. According to a police report, Ms. Parscale also said her husband had bruised her arms during \u201da physical altercation.\u201d She later walked back the claim of domestic abuse. Since that episode, which was caught on police body camera footage, Mr. Parscale has claimed he wants to go back to a simpler, more private life flipping real estate. He has told friends he wants to leave politics. Current and former Trump officials on Tuesday interpreted Mr. Parscale\u2019s re-emergence as an attempt to increase the value of a memoir he is also trying to sell and to ingratiate himself with the president. Mr. Parscale said in the Fox interview that he had not spoken to Mr. Trump recently, and that the fracturing of their relationship was \u201cpretty hurtful.\u201d \u201cI gave every inch of my life to them,\u201d he said of the Trump family. \u201cEvery inch.\u201d At another point in the interview, he claimed that he was a \u201csemi-quasi campaign manager\u201d during Mr. Trump\u2019s winning 2016 campaign, alongside Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law. In fact, Kellyanne Conway, a former White House official, was the president\u2019s campaign manager four years ago. \u201cThe worst thing to ever do was to break us two up,\u201d Mr. Parscale said of his relationship with Mr. Kushner, claiming that the president\u2019s son-in-law was also \u201cslightly sidelined\u201d after his demotion. Addressing the altercation in September for the first time, Mr. Parscale hinted at strains in his marriage but did not address the abuse allegation. Martha MacCallum, the Fox News host who conducted the interview, did not ask him about it. \u201cWe lost two children during the election,\u201d Mr. Parscale said, referring to the death of their twins in 2016. \u201cWe were completely attacked by the left, the right, the media. And I got to a bad place.\u201d He said that he and his wife had \u201cnever been happier,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m just glad I moved on.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Who Has Been Pardoned by Trump So Far? According to the Justice Department, President Trump has granted clemency to dozens of people during his term in office, including pardoning his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn in November. Mr. Trump has commuted the sentences of just 11 people, after receiving more than 8,500 petitions for commutations, the department said. President Barack Obama commuted the sentences of 1,715 people during his two terms in office, having received more than 33,000 requests, while President George W. Bush commuted the sentences of 11, with more than 8,500 requests. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution gives presidents unlimited authority to grant pardons, which excuse or forgive a federal crime. A commutation, by contrast, makes a punishment milder without wiping out the underlying conviction. Here are some of the pardons and commutations issued by Mr. Trump: Pardon: Nov. 25, 2020 Michael T. Flynn, a former national security adviser who twice pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with a Russian diplomat, and whose prosecution Attorney General William P. Barr tried to shut down, was the only White House official to be convicted as part of the Trump-Russia investigation. In a statement about Mr. Flynn\u2019s pardon, White House officials said he never should have been prosecuted and that the president\u2019s action had finally brought \u201cto an end the relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man.\u201d Commutation: July 10, 2020 Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime friend and adviser of Mr. Trump, was sentenced in February 2020 to more than three years in prison in a politically fraught case that put the president at odds with his attorney general. Mr. Stone was convicted of seven felony charges, including lying under oath to a congressional committee and threatening a witness whose testimony would have exposed those lies. In a statement, the White House denounced the \u201coverzealous prosecutors\u201d who had convicted Mr. Stone on \u201cprocess-based charges\u201d stemming from the \u201cwitch hunts\u201d and \u201cRussia hoax\u201d investigation.  Pardon: Aug. 25, 2017 Joe Arpaio, an anti-immigration crusader who enjoyed calling himself \u201cAmerica\u2019s toughest sheriff,\u201d was the first pardon of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Once one of the most popular \u2014 and divisive \u2014 figures in Arizona, Mr. Arpaio was elected sheriff of Maricopa County five times before he was ultimately charged with criminal contempt for defying a court order to stop detaining people solely on the suspicion that they were undocumented immigrants. Mr. Arpaio was pardoned less than a month after he was found guilty. Pardon: May 15, 2019 Conrad M. Black, a former press baron and friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, was granted a full pardon 12 years after his sentencing for fraud and obstruction of justice. Mr. Black, who once owned The Chicago Sun-Times, The Jerusalem Post and The Daily Telegraph of London, among other newspapers, was convicted of fraud in 2007 with three other former executives of Hollinger International.  Mr. Black, who was released from prison in 2012, is the author of several pro-Trump opinion articles as well as a flattering book, \u201cDonald J. Trump: A President Like No Other.\u201d COMMUTATION: Feb. 18, 2020 Former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois was sentenced in 2011 to 14 years in prison for trying to sell or trade to the highest bidder the Senate seat that Mr. Obama vacated after he was elected president.  In 2010, while Mr. Blagojevich was awaiting trial, he was a contestant on \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d a reality TV series hosted by Mr. Trump. Mr. Blagojevich was fired at the end of that season\u2019s fourth episode. Pardon: May 31, 2018 Dinesh D\u2019Souza received a presidential pardon after pleading guilty to making illegal campaign contributions in 2014. Mr. D\u2019Souza, a filmmaker and author whose subjects often dabble in conspiracy theories, had long blamed his conviction on his political opposition to Mr. Obama. In issuing his pardon, Mr. Trump said that Mr. D\u2019Souza had been \u201ctreated very unfairly by our government,\u201d echoing a claim the commentator has often made himself. Pardon: Feb. 18, 2020 Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., a former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, pleaded guilty in 1998 to concealing an extortion plot. Mr. DeBartolo was prosecuted after he gave Edwin W. Edwards, the influential former governor of Louisiana, $400,000 to secure a riverboat gambling license for his gambling consortium. Although Mr. DeBartolo avoided prison, he was fined $1 million and was suspended for a year by the N.F.L. commutation: June 6, 2018; Pardon: Aug. 28, 2019 Alice Marie Johnson was serving life in a federal prison for a nonviolent drug conviction before her case was brought to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention by the reality television star Kim Kardashian West. The president\u2019s decision to commute her sentence freed Ms. Johnson, who had been locked up in Alabama since 1996 on charges related to cocaine distribution and money laundering. Mr. Trump later pardoned Ms. Johnson on Aug. 28, 2019. Pardons: 2018-20 Mr. Trump has issued posthumous pardons to three historical figures. Jack Johnson, the first Black heavyweight boxing champion, was tarnished by a racially tainted criminal conviction in 1913 \u2014 for transporting a white woman across state lines \u2014 that haunted him well after his death in 1946. Mr. Trump pardoned him on May 24, 2018. Susan B. Anthony, the women\u2019s suffragist, was arrested in Rochester, N.Y., in 1872 for voting illegally and was fined $100. Mr. Trump pardoned her on Aug. 18, the 100th anniversary of the ratification of 19th Amendment, which extended voting rights to women. Zay Jeffries, a metal scientist whose contributions to the Manhattan Project and whose development of armor-piercing artillery shells helped the Allies win World War II, was granted a posthumous pardon on Oct. 10, 2019. Jeffries was found guilty in 1948 of an antitrust violation related to his work and was fined $2,500. Pardon: Feb. 18, 2020 Ten years ago, Bernard B. Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner, was sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to eight felony charges, including tax fraud and lying to White House officials.  Mr. Trump said he heard from more than a dozen people about pardoning Mr. Kerik, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. Mr. Kerik\u2019s rise to prominence dates to the 1993 campaign for mayor in New York City, when he served as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s bodyguard and chauffeur. After the pardon was announced, Mr. Kerik expressed his gratitude to Mr. Trump on Twitter. \u201cWith the exception of the birth of my children,\u201d he wrote, \u201ctoday is one of the greatest days in my life.\u201d Pardon: April 13, 2018 I. Lewis Libby Jr., known as Scooter, was Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s top adviser before Mr. Libby was convicted in 2007 of four felony counts, including perjury and obstruction of justice, in connection with the disclosure of the identity of a C.I.A. officer, Valerie Plame. Mr. Libby had maintained his innocence for years, and his portrayal as a victim of an unfair prosecution ultimately found favor with Mr. Trump. Pardon: Nov. 15, 2019 Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to clear three members of the armed services who had been accused or convicted of war crimes signaled that the president intended to use his power as the ultimate arbiter of military justice. He ordered full pardons of Clint Lorance, a former Army lieutenant who was serving a 19-year sentence for the murder of two civilians, and Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, an Army Special Forces officer who was facing murder charges for killing an unarmed Afghan he believed was a Taliban bomb maker. The president also reversed the demotion of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who had been acquitted of murder charges but convicted of a lesser offense in a high-profile war crimes case. All three had been championed by prominent conservatives who had portrayed them as war heroes unfairly prosecuted for actions taken in the heat and confusion of battle. Pardon: Feb. 18, 2020 Michael R. Milken was the billionaire \u201cjunk bond king\u201d and a well-known financier on Wall Street in the 1980s. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy charges and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, though his sentence was later reduced to two. He also agreed to pay $600 million in fines and penalties.  Mr. Milken did not have a pardon or commutation application pending at the Justice Department\u2019s pardons office, meaning that the president made that decision entirely without official department input. Among those arguing for Mr. Milken to be pardoned was Mr. Giuliani, who as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York prosecuted Mr. Milken. Pardon: July 10, 2018 Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven Hammond, were Oregon cattle ranchers who had been serving five-year sentences for arson on federal land. Their cases inspired an antigovernment group\u2019s weekslong standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016 and brought widespread attention to anger over federal land management in the Western United States. The occupation, led by the Bundy family, drew militia members who commandeered government buildings and vehicles in tactical gear and long guns, promising to defend the family. During his campaign, Mr. Trump played to that sense of Western grievance, and the pardon of the Hammonds was a signal to conservatives that he was sympathetic. Pardon: Feb. 18, 2020 David H. Safavian, the top federal procurement official under President George W. Bush, was sentenced in 2009 to a year in prison for covering up his ties to Jack Abramoff, the disgraced lobbyist whose corruption became a symbol of the excesses of Washington influence peddling. Mr. Safavian was convicted of obstruction of justice and making false statements. Pardon: Feb. 18, 2020 Angela Stanton \u2014 an author, television personality and motivational speaker \u2014 served six months of home confinement in 2007 for her role in a stolen-vehicle ring. Her book \u201cLife of a Real Housewife\u201d explores her difficult upbringing and her encounters with reality TV stars. Before her pardon, she gave interviews in which she declared her support for Mr. Trump. In announcing her pardon, the White House credited her with working \u201ctirelessly to improve re-entry outcomes for people returning to their communities upon release from prison.\u201d Mr. Trump has pardoned a number of other people, including a construction executive whose family donated heavily to the president\u2019s re-election effort and a man convicted of bank robbery who started a nonprofit that helps former prisoners. Paul Pogue, a former owner of a Texas construction company, was pardoned on Feb. 18, 2020, for tax charges after his family contributed more than $200,000 to Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election effort. Ariel Friedler, a former executive of a software development company who pleaded guilty to conspiring to hack a competitor, secured a pardon on Feb. 18, 2020, with the help of Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and a close ally of Mr. Trump\u2019s. Michael Chase Behenna, a former Army lieutenant, served five years in prison for fatally shooting an Iraqi man in American custody in 2008. Mr. Trump pardoned him on May 6, 2019. His case had \u201cattracted broad support from the military, Oklahoma elected officials, and the public,\u201d according to the White House. Patrick James Nolan, a Republican former leader of the California State Assembly, pleaded guilty in 1994 to corruption charges and accepted a 33-month sentence. After his release, he became a supporter of criminal justice reform, according to the White House. Mr. Trump pardoned him on May 15, 2019. Michael Anthony Tedesco, who was convicted of drug trafficking and fraud in 1990, was pardoned on July 29, 2019. President Obama had already pardoned Mr. Tedesco in 2017, but Mr. Trump\u2019s action fixed a clerical error related to the pardoning of Mr. Tedesco\u2019s fraud conviction. Roy Wayne McKeever was arrested on charges of transporting marijuana from Mexico to Oklahoma in 1989, when he was 19, and was sentenced to one year in prison. Mr. Trump pardoned him on July 29, 2019. A White House statement called him \u201can active member of the Sheriffs\u2019 Association of Texas.\u201d John Richard Bubala pleaded guilty to the improper use of federal property in 1990 and was pardoned on July 29, 2019. A White House statement said Mr. Bubala had been transferring automotive equipment to an Indiana town for maintenance and his \u201cprimary aim was to help the town.\u201d Chalmer Lee Williams was an airport baggage handler who was convicted on charges related to the theft and sale of weapons and was sentenced to four months in prison in 1995. The White House said in a statement that Mr. Williams had accepted responsibility for his actions. Mr. Trump pardoned him on July 29, 2019. Rodney M. Takumi, who was arrested while working at an illegal gambling parlor in 1987, pleaded no contest and was sentenced to two years of probation and fined $250. Mr. Trump pardoned him on July 29, 2019. The White House said Mr. Takumi was the owner of a tax preparation franchise in the Navajo Nation. Jon Donyae Ponder, who pleaded guilty to bank robbery in 2005, started a nonprofit that helps former prisoners after he was released from prison in 2009. Mr. Trump pardoned him on Aug. 25, 2020, shortly before the Republican National Convention entered its second night. The pardon was announced in a seven-minute video in which the president called Mr. Ponder\u2019s life \u201ca beautiful testament to the power of redemption.\u201d Christina Morales contributed reporting.",

    "article_text": "As Trump Rages, Voters in a Key County Move On: \u2018I\u2019m Not Sweating It\u2019 DOYLESTOWN, Pa. \u2014 Even before the presidential transition was underway, Mike Carr had started to move on with his life. It\u2019s not as though much about American politics had changed in the immediate aftermath of the election, he noted. President Trump was still tweeting baseless conspiracy theories about voter fraud in all caps; cable news panels were still debating the effect the frenzy of accusations would have on democracy. These were the kinds of things that, before the election, would have demanded Mr. Carr\u2019s full attention. For most of the president\u2019s term, Mr. Carr, a 53-year-old real estate lawyer, had been relentlessly attuned to the news cycle and the damage he felt Mr. Trump had done to the country. But ever since Nov. 7, when the election was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Carr has given himself permission to keep the television on mute. \u201cIt\u2019s like a weight has been lifted,\u201d said Mr. Carr, who voted a straight Democratic ticket on Nov. 3, as he did in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice not to be as plugged in.\u201d In Bucks County, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia and one of the state\u2019s most consistently competitive counties down ballot, ardent Biden supporters like Mr. Carr could be forgiven for not unplugging entirely. Their candidate may have won their state by 1.2 percentage points, their county by more than four, but Mr. Trump and his legal team have continued to dispute the results, filing multiple lawsuits, losing multiple lawsuits and parroting unfounded allegations of fraud in the parking lot of a landscaping business not 45 minutes away. By trying to sow distrust in America\u2019s electoral infrastructure and egging on his advisers as they speak openly of a second term, Mr. Trump has confirmed some of his detractors\u2019 worst fears. Yet even in a state at the center of the president\u2019s attacks, in a county where pre-election tensions ran high, many Biden supporters find themselves increasingly comfortable tuning out, moving on and looking forward to January. As in other counties across Pennsylvania and the country, Bucks County has seen a spike in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, with about 64 residents dying from the virus in November, the highest toll since the spring. For many voters here, worries about the virus, coupled with an overwhelming sense of Trump fatigue, have relegated the president to little more than a postelection footnote. Sure, these voters acknowledged, Mr. Trump may still hold the power of the presidency and may, in their estimation, have no qualms about abusing it. But when it comes to the results of the election, they\u2019ve taken to viewing his message as more of a nuisance with a sell-by date than a lasting danger to democracy \u2014 the rantings of a sore loser rather than the opening act of a coup by the leader of the free world. \u201cHe\u2019s just a whiny kid who didn\u2019t get his way. I\u2019m not sweating it,\u201d said Blake Lertzman, 39, while taking a smoke break outside his technology repair shop in the Bucks County seat of Doylestown. \u201cRight now it\u2019s all about the virus. I worry about me and my girlfriend and my community.\u201d As for Mr. Trump\u2019s fervent efforts to overturn the election, \u201cnobody cares,\u201d Mr. Lertzman went on, \u201cunless you\u2019re the kind of person who goes on Newsmax.\u201d Doylestown, which has about 8,300 residents and is over 90 percent white, leans further left than many other boroughs and townships in Bucks County. Nevertheless, many residents take pride in their region as an incubator of centrist politics, citing the county\u2019s record, for instance, of voting for Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 while helping re-elect Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican. Republicans and Democrats alike here recall Mike Fitzpatrick, the moderate Republican congressman who died of brain cancer this year, with fondness. And while many Democrats lament that his brother and successor, Brian Fitzpatrick \u2014 a Republican who represents Pennsylvania\u2019s First District and just won re-election by 13 points \u2014 voted against impeaching Mr. Trump, they will also note unprompted that Mr. Fitzpatrick was recently ranked by the Lugar Center, a nonprofit in Washington, as the most bipartisan member of the House. \u201cWe generally produce candidates in both parties that are pretty moderate,\u201d said Ron Strouse, the mayor of Doylestown, a Democrat who describes himself as a \u201cpractical progressive.\u201d \u201cThe history of ticket-splitting certainly showed this year.\u201d Still, like a number of other self-consciously moderate locales across America, Bucks County was not insulated from the partisan and cultural crosscurrents that defined the presidential election. And as the county seat, Doylestown played host to their suburban Philadelphia iteration. \u201cRallies, counter-rallies, protests, demonstrations \u2014 we\u2019ve had more than 45 since the beginning of this year alone,\u201d Mr. Strouse said. In early September, hundreds gathered in the borough for dueling Black Lives Matter and \u201cBack the Blue\u201d demonstrations, the latter of which included a sea of Trump merchandise and a man reportedly shouting racial slurs and displaying a Nazi salute. In October, as part of a pro-Trump \u201croad rally,\u201d more than 1,000 of the president\u2019s supporters clogged traffic for miles as they converged on Doylestown, where they were met by a counter-demonstration of Biden supporters. Local businesses boarding up in anticipation of summer protests, Trump supporters brandishing Confederate flags as they cruised down Main Street: Doylestown residents recited no shortage of ways their typically placid borough had seemed \u201ctense\u201d in the lead-up to the election. But in the weeks since, even as Mr. Trump has electrified much of his base with his false claims of fraud and his campaign\u2019s harried appeals via text to \u201cchip in $10\u201d to \u201cSTOP THE RADICAL Left from counting any ILLEGAL ballots,\u201d Doylestown has remained at a calm remove. Demonstrations by Trump and Biden supporters alike, once a near-constant presence across town, have ground to a halt. \u201cPeople are more willing to tune out the theater now,\u201d said Anthony Palazzolo, 30, who is a volunteer at the Doylestown Historical Society and a registered Republican who voted for Mr. Biden. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed it in small things, like people are less on their phones and interacting more on the sidewalks. People are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d According to Mr. Palazzolo and others, the growing sang-froid about Mr. Trump\u2019s conspiracy-mongering, even among the area\u2019s most ardent Democrats, is in part a credit to local party leadership, members of which were quick to present a unified front after the county\u2019s votes were tabulated \u2014 offering Bucks County residents a bipartisan show of confidence in their own results even as the president tried to seed doubt and promote division across the state. \u201cOur county had a great election, and that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d said Pat Poprick, the chair of the Bucks County Republican Committee. \u201cI do not think there was any quote-unquote fraud here.\u201d Yet for all their fears of Mr. Trump, many Biden supporters here also expressed confidence that the country\u2019s democratic institutions and traditions were robust enough to withstand the president\u2019s attempts to subvert them \u2014 if only for two more months. Larissa Hopwood, 41, a children\u2019s musician and teacher, was among Mr. Biden\u2019s most vocal supporters in Doylestown, taking the lead in organizing pro-Biden rallies to counteract the steady stream of Trump demonstrations. Ms. Hopwood said the stakes of the presidential election could not have felt higher, particularly because she is the mother of a gender nonconforming child. The day after the election, she attended a \u201cProtect the Results\u201d rally in town. But armed with a confidence that, come Jan. 20, Mr. Biden will be president of the United States, no matter how many lawsuits Mr. Trump files, she has found herself embracing a new sense of lightness, however incrementally. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize it for awhile, but for a week after Biden won, I posted zero Instagrams,\u201d she said. \u201cI think my mind-set was, \u2018Let\u2019s just tune it out: We had our victory.\u2019\u201d Still, despite feeling perhaps a bit less compelled to post and engage daily with political content, she admitted being frustrated by how \u201cpuffy\u201d her social feeds seemed shortly after the election \u2014 posts about lighter topics like, say, \u201cThe Crown,\u201d or People magazine\u2019s \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d cover. But any concerns about complacency among fellow progressives seemed to stem less from concerns over Mr. Trump\u2019s language and actions in this moment, and more from a desire to maintain momentum heading into the Biden era. In other words, Ms. Hopwood said, she\u2019s not terribly worried that a presidential coup is afoot. \u201cThere are government employees in charge of making this transition happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, we are still the United States.\u201d And ultimately, for Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters here, blocking out the president is all the easier when even the neighborhood\u2019s most outspoken Trump supporter seems to have moved on. Daniel Compain, 65, a Cuban-American who fled Fidel Castro\u2019s regime as a child, beamed as he recalled how pedestrians would grimace as they passed the enormous Trump flag he\u2019d hung outside the window of his apartment near Main Street. In an interview at a Starbucks nearby, he maintained that he would not accept the results of the election until the Electoral College officially voted in mid-December. He also had questions, he said, about whether Dominion voting machines had deleted ballots cast for Mr. Trump, echoing false claims made by the president and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. And yet when asked why he had decided to take his Trump flag down, Mr. Compain responded as if the answer were self-evident. \u201cWell, the election is over,\u201d he said.",

    "article_text": "Biden\u2019s Cabinet Picks, Part 2: Antony Blinken What kind of foreign policy is possible for the United States after four years of isolationism under President Trump? Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s pick for secretary of state, has an interventionist streak \u2014 a position influenced by hearing the stories of his stepfather, a holocaust survivor, and by witnessing, when part of the Clinton administration, the consequences of not having intervened earlier to stop the Rwandan genocide. But some vestiges of Trump-era foreign policy will be hard to upend. If confirmed, Mr. Blinken faces the challenge of making the case at home that taking a fuller role abroad is important, while persuading international allies that the United States is back and can be counted on. What course is he likely to steer through that narrow channel? David E. Sanger, a national security correspondent for The New York Times. Mr. Blinken\u2019s extensive foreign policy credentials are expected to help calm American diplomats and global leaders after four years of the Trump administration\u2019s ricocheting strategies and nationalist swaggering. European allies of the United States have welcomed a president who doesn\u2019t see them as rivals. But with the possibility of a Republican-controlled Senate, they are also wary. Mr. Biden wants to reactivate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, but the killing of the top nuclear scientist in the Middle Eastern nation, which Tehran has blamed on Israel, could complicate that aim.

    "article_text": "Barr Acknowledges Justice Dept. Has Found No Widespread Voter Fraud WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General William P. Barr acknowledged on Tuesday that the Justice Department has uncovered no voting fraud \u201con a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,\u201d a striking repudiation of President Trump\u2019s groundless claims that he was defrauded. The statement from Mr. Barr affirming Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s win served as a particularly harsh blow to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the election. Mr. Barr has advanced Mr. Trump\u2019s political agenda perhaps more than any other cabinet member, bringing the Justice Department as close to the White House as it has been since Watergate. His comments came as other Republicans separated themselves on Tuesday from Mr. Trump\u2019s charged complaints about the election. A Georgia elections official angrily denounced the violent threats and harassment directed at elections workers and urged the president to \u201cstop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence.\u201d \u201cSomeone\u2019s going to get hurt,\u201d the official, Gabriel Sterling, said at a news conference. \u201cSomeone\u2019s going to get shot. Someone\u2019s going to get killed.\u201d And Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who has refused to recognize Mr. Trump\u2019s election loss, moved closer to overtly accepting the reality that Mr. Biden would be in the White House next year as he discussed the prospects for more pandemic stimulus in 2021. \u201cAfter the first of the year, there is likely to be a discussion about some additional package of some size next year, depending upon what the new administration wants to pursue,\u201d Mr. McConnell said on Capitol Hill. Mr. Barr had been mostly silent since the election, but some Republicans privately pushed him to publicly rebut Mr. Trump, according to a person told of those conversations. His comments may have been prompted by Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly specious election claims; the president suggested on Sunday that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. may have played a role in an election fraud. Mr. Barr took particular aim at a widely discredited conspiracy theory promoted by the president\u2019s legal team involving machines manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems, a company that sells voting hardware. \u201cThere\u2019s been one assertion that would be systemic fraud, and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the D.H.S. and D.O.J. have looked into that, and so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything to substantiate that,\u201d Mr. Barr said, referring to the Department of Homeland Security and his own department. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Mr. Barr discussed his findings on voter fraud with the White House before he made his public comments on Tuesday. Mr. Barr\u2019s acknowledgment of the election results was an about-face from his posture during the campaign. But he spoke out only after the president spent weeks promoting baseless assertions about the election outcome and long after department lawyers assigned to monitor elections for signs of fraud told Mr. Barr that they had found no evidence of substantial irregularities. And even as Mr. Barr distanced himself from the president\u2019s election claims, the Justice Department also announced a move certain to please Mr. Trump: Mr. Barr has given additional protections to John H. Durham, the federal prosecutor whose examination of the Russia investigation Mr. Trump had embraced. The move makes it more difficult for the Biden administration to fire Mr. Durham without providing evidence of misconduct. The president\u2019s allies immediately pushed back on Mr. Barr\u2019s election assessment. Trump campaign lawyers complained that the Justice Department investigations had been anemic. Rudolph W. Giuliani, a lawyer for Mr. Trump who has been at the forefront of promoting his election conspiracy theories, said that his team had gathered evidence of illegal voting in six states, backed up by sworn witness\u00a0statements, and that the Justice Department had failed to investigate what the team had uncovered.\u00a0 \u201cAs far as we know, not a single one has been interviewed by the D.O.J.,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said in a statement. \u201cThe Justice Department also hasn\u2019t audited any voting machines or used their subpoena powers to determine the truth.\u201d Mr. Barr had given prosecutors the authority to examine allegations by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies of voter ineligibility in Nevada and improperly dated mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania. The results of those investigations have not been publicly disclosed, but Mr. Barr\u2019s remarks suggested that any impropriety was too insignificant to change the election results. \u201cMost claims of fraud are very particularized to a particular set of circumstances or actors or conduct. They are not systemic allegations, and those have been run down; they are being run down,\u201d he said. \u201cSome have been broad and potentially cover a few thousand votes. They have been followed up on.\u201d The Trump campaign and its surrogates have filed dozens of lawsuits in battleground states that have offered an array of attacks on the election results: arguing that mail-in ballots were illegally used, that absentee ballots were improperly counted and that poll challengers were denied proper access to monitor vote counts. Some of the lawsuits have echoed Mr. Giuliani\u2019s talk of conspiracies that foreign powers like Venezuela worked with corrupt American officials to manipulate voting machines. Others made much smaller claims, contesting the validity of tiny batches of as few as 60 ballots. But none, at least so far, have won Mr. Trump anything more significant than the ability to move his poll observers from 10 feet to six feet away from workers counting votes in Pennsylvania. The campaign and its allies have now lost nearly 40 cases across the country as judge after judge \u2014 including some appointed by Mr. Trump \u2014 discredited the efforts as lacking both legal merit and convincing proof. Mr. Barr also suggested that lawsuits or audits by elections officials served as remedies for suspicions of election irregularities, not criminal inquiries. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fix-all, and people don\u2019t like something, they want the Department of Justice to come in and \u2018investigate,\u2019\u201d Mr. Barr said in the Associated Press interview. Mr. Barr has potentially placed himself in a precarious position with Mr. Trump, who recently fired Christopher Krebs, the senior cybersecurity official responsible for securing the presidential election, who prominently disputed Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims that the presidency was stolen. \u201cI guess he is the next one to be fired since he now, too, says there is no fraud,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, said of Mr. Barr. The attorney general traveled to the White House on Tuesday afternoon, prompting speculation about his future, but he was there to attend a previously scheduled meeting, a spokeswoman said. In the months before the November election, Mr. Barr had been one of the loudest voices sounding alarms about widespread fraud, claiming repeatedly in speeches and interviews that the potential for it was high and that it posed a grave danger to the election. Mr. Barr\u2019s claims were often false or exaggerated and were widely refuted. Predicting in September that mail-in voting would lead to unprecedented voter fraud, he called his assertion \u201ccommon sense.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have empirical evidence other than the fact that we\u2019ve always had voting fraud,\u201d Mr. Barr said at the time. \u201cAnd there always will be people who attempt to do that.\u201d His comments unnerved Democrats and voting rights advocates as he simultaneously relaxed Justice Department guidelines that discouraged prosecutors from taking investigative steps around an election that could become public and undermine Americans\u2019 confidence in the results. In the weeks before the election, the Justice Department also made the highly unusual move of releasing details about voter fraud investigations, which fed Mr. Trump\u2019s narrative warning of voting irregularities in an effort to erode voters\u2019 faith in the outcome of the race.

    "article_text": "\u2018It Has to Stop\u2019: Georgia Election Official Lashes Trump ATLANTA \u2014 In one of the most striking rebukes to President Trump since he launched his baseless attacks on the American electoral process, a top-ranking Georgia election official lashed out at the president on Tuesday for failing to condemn threats of violence against people overseeing the voting system in his state. \u201cIt has to stop,\u201d Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and Georgia\u2019s voting system implementation manager, said at an afternoon news conference at the state Capitol, his voice shaking with emotion. \u201cMr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is elections. This is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It\u2019s too much.\u201d Mr. Sterling\u2019s outburst of anger and frustration came amid a sustained assault on Georgia\u2019s election process by Mr. Trump as he seeks to reverse his loss to his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Sterling, who previously said he had received threats himself, said that threats had also been made against the wife of his superior, Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state. \u201cMr. President, it looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia,\u201d Mr. Sterling said. He added that the president needed to \u201cstep up\u201d and say, \u201cStop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone is going to get hurt, someone is going to get shot, someone is going to get killed. And it\u2019s not right.\u201d Mr. Sterling also called on the state\u2019s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, to condemn the rhetoric that he said was getting dangerously out of hand. The two senators, both Trump loyalists, have called for Mr. Raffensperger to resign. As Mr. Trump hurls false claims of fraud in Georgia, a number of lawsuits filed by conservatives in state and federal courts are seeking to decertify the results. The second of two recounts requested by the Trump campaign is in progress and is expected to wind up Wednesday. And the Georgia Republican Party has descended into a state of virtual civil war as some of its most powerful players maneuver and malign their rivals, seeking advantage, or at least survival. In the meantime, Mr. Trump continues to lash out at Gov. Brian Kemp and Mr. Raffensperger, both staunch Republicans and Trump supporters, over the fact that he lost Georgia, saying they have not sufficiently rooted out fraud. As late as Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump made the latest in a series of unsubstantiated claims about the Georgia election, writing on Twitter that the state had been \u201cscammed\u201d and urging Mr. Kemp to \u201ccall off\" the election. Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have taken to the streets and the Capitol building in downtown Atlanta, where the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of Infowars recently joined them. In other cases, Trump supporters have harassed or threatened Mr. Sterling, Mr. Raffensperger and others. In a statement Tuesday evening, Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said: \u201cThe campaign is focused on ensuring that all legal votes are counted and all illegal votes are not. No one should engage in threats or violence, and if that has happened, we condemn that fully.\u201d Amid all of this, Mr. Sterling, a detail-oriented former city councilman from the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs, has taken on a prominent role in the state as it conducted its recounts. Along with Mr. Raffensperger, he has often been the main speaker in numerous news conferences in which he has explained the complexities of Georgia\u2019s election and recount systems and has argued that the results, which currently show Mr. Biden winning by about 12,700 votes, are trustworthy. Ari Schaffer, press secretary for the secretary of state\u2019s office, did not answer directly when asked Tuesday whether Mr. Raffensperger had given Mr. Sterling his blessing to speak out so forcefully against the president. But he noted that the deputy secretary of state, Jordan Fuchs, had been standing near Mr. Sterling when he made his statements. \u201cGabriel has my support,\u201d Ms. Fuchs said independently in a text message. Late Tuesday, representatives for Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue said they condemned violence of any kind but also said they would not apologize for seeking accountability and accuracy in the state\u2019s elections.  In the second of two news conferences called by the secretary of state\u2019s office on Tuesday, Mr. Sterling, speaking loudly, emotionally and deliberately, said that people had intruded on Mr. Raffensperger\u2019s personal property. He said that Mr. Raffensperger\u2019s wife \u201cis getting sexualized threats through her cellphone.\u201d He mentioned that he had police protection outside his own house, a topic he had also broached in a Nov. 21 tweet. \u201cSo this is fun \u2026 multiple attempted hacks of my emails, police protection around my home, the threats,\u201d Mr. Sterling wrote then. \u201cBut all is well \u2026 following the law, following the process \u2026 doing our jobs.\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Sterling also made references to reports that Joe diGenova, a lawyer for the Trump campaign, had said that Chris Krebs \u2014 a former federal cybersecurity official who vouched that the election was clean \u2014 should be shot. (Mr. diGenova later said his remarks had been \u201cmade in jest.\u201d) But Mr. Sterling said that \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d had involved a threat against a 20-year-old contractor for a voting system company in Gwinnett County. He said the young worker had been targeted by someone who hung a noose and declared that the worker should be \u201chung for treason,\u201d simply for doing a routine element of his job. Mr. Sterling did not provide any other details. \u201cI can\u2019t begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every American, every Georgian, Republican and Democrat alike, should have that same level of anger.\u201d Details of the noose incident Mr. Sterling cited could not be corroborated Tuesday. Cpl. Ryan Winderweedle, a spokesman for the Gwinnett County Police Department, said that he did not have any information about such an incident but noted that it could have occurred beyond that department\u2019s jurisdiction. Joe Sorenson, a spokesman for the county government, said in an email that \u201ccitizen monitors\u201d had \u201charassed\u201d some county technology workers who were doing work that was unrelated to the elections but that involved going in and out of a storage area in the same building as the county elections office.

    "article_text": "Justice Dept. Investigating Potential Bribery Scheme for Trump Pardon The Justice Department has been investigating whether intermediaries for a federal convict offered White House officials a bribe in exchange for a potential pardon or commutation from President Trump, according to court documents unsealed by a federal judge on Tuesday. The documents were heavily redacted, and it was unclear who may have been involved. Nothing directly tied Mr. Trump to the scheme, and the documents said no one had been charged. But the documents offered a few clues about what the White House may have known about the scheme. One passage appears to show that a lawyer for the convict had discussions with the White House Counsel\u2019s Office about a pardon or commutation, but it was unclear whether the discussions were part of the scheme or a normal back-and-forth with the White House about a convict\u2019s case. Late Tuesday, Mr. Trump used Twitter to briefly address the disclosure of the investigation, calling it \u201cFake News.\u201d The information about the potential scheme was included in an opinion, dated Aug. 28, from the chief United States district judge for the District of Columbia, Beryl A. Howell, who was weighing whether to allow federal prosecutors to examine evidence \u2014 like emails \u2014 that may have been protected by attorney-client privilege. Judge Howell granted the prosecutors access to the materials. Investigators suspected that the convict seeking the pardon was imprisoned as recently as this summer and that two people working on behalf of the convict may have undertaken a secret lobbying campaign by approaching White House officials, according to the documents. The two people may have offered to funnel money as political donations in exchange for the pardon or commutation, although it was unclear where the money was supposed to be sent. Given Mr. Trump\u2019s undisciplined approach to pardons, the disclosure, coming amid a flurry of reports about how Mr. Trump has been discussing whether to pardon his children and close confidants in the final weeks of his presidency, raised fears that the pardon process may have been corrupted. Mr. Trump pardoned his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn on Wednesday, and had talks with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani last week about a pre-emptive pardon for Mr. Giuliani before he leaves office. The president has also had discussions with advisers about how he fears that a Biden Justice Department could seek retribution against him by prosecuting his children.",

    "article_text": "\u2018It Has to Stop\u2019: Georgia Election Official Lashes Trump ATLANTA \u2014 In one of the most striking rebukes to President Trump since he launched his baseless attacks on the American electoral process, a top-ranking Georgia election official lashed out at the president on Tuesday for failing to condemn threats of violence against people overseeing the voting system in his state. \u201cIt has to stop,\u201d Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and Georgia\u2019s voting system implementation manager, said at an afternoon news conference at the state Capitol, his voice shaking with emotion. \u201cMr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is elections. This is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It\u2019s too much.\u201d Mr. Sterling\u2019s outburst of anger and frustration came amid a sustained assault on Georgia\u2019s election process by Mr. Trump as he seeks to reverse his loss to his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Sterling, who previously said he had received threats himself, said that threats had also been made against the wife of his superior, Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state. \u201cMr. President, it looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia,\u201d Mr. Sterling said. He added that the president needed to \u201cstep up\u201d and say, \u201cStop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone is going to get hurt, someone is going to get shot, someone is going to get killed. And it\u2019s not right.\u201d Mr. Sterling also called on the state\u2019s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, to condemn the rhetoric that he said was getting dangerously out of hand. The two senators, both Trump loyalists, have called for Mr. Raffensperger to resign. As Mr. Trump hurls false claims of fraud in Georgia, a number of lawsuits filed by conservatives in state and federal courts are seeking to decertify the results. The second of two recounts requested by the Trump campaign is in progress and is expected to wind up Wednesday. And the Georgia Republican Party has descended into a state of virtual civil war as some of its most powerful players maneuver and malign their rivals, seeking advantage, or at least survival. In the meantime, Mr. Trump continues to lash out at Gov. Brian Kemp and Mr. Raffensperger, both staunch Republicans and Trump supporters, over the fact that he lost Georgia, saying they have not sufficiently rooted out fraud. As late as Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump made the latest in a series of unsubstantiated claims about the Georgia election, writing on Twitter that the state had been \u201cscammed\u201d and urging Mr. Kemp to \u201ccall off\" the election. Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have taken to the streets and the Capitol building in downtown Atlanta, where the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of Infowars recently joined them. In other cases, Trump supporters have harassed or threatened Mr. Sterling, Mr. Raffensperger and others. In a statement Tuesday evening, Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said: \u201cThe campaign is focused on ensuring that all legal votes are counted and all illegal votes are not. No one should engage in threats or violence, and if that has happened, we condemn that fully.\u201d Amid all of this, Mr. Sterling, a detail-oriented former city councilman from the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs, has taken on a prominent role in the state as it conducted its recounts. Along with Mr. Raffensperger, he has often been the main speaker in numerous news conferences in which he has explained the complexities of Georgia\u2019s election and recount systems and has argued that the results, which currently show Mr. Biden winning by about 12,700 votes, are trustworthy. Ari Schaffer, press secretary for the secretary of state\u2019s office, did not answer directly when asked Tuesday whether Mr. Raffensperger had given Mr. Sterling his blessing to speak out so forcefully against the president. But he noted that the deputy secretary of state, Jordan Fuchs, had been standing near Mr. Sterling when he made his statements. \u201cGabriel has my support,\u201d Ms. Fuchs said independently in a text message. Late Tuesday, representatives for Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue said they condemned violence of any kind but also said they would not apologize for seeking accountability and accuracy in the state\u2019s elections.  In the second of two news conferences called by the secretary of state\u2019s office on Tuesday, Mr. Sterling, speaking loudly, emotionally and deliberately, said that people had intruded on Mr. Raffensperger\u2019s personal property. He said that Mr. Raffensperger\u2019s wife \u201cis getting sexualized threats through her cellphone.\u201d He mentioned that he had police protection outside his own house, a topic he had also broached in a Nov. 21 tweet. \u201cSo this is fun \u2026 multiple attempted hacks of my emails, police protection around my home, the threats,\u201d Mr. Sterling wrote then. \u201cBut all is well \u2026 following the law, following the process \u2026 doing our jobs.\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Sterling also made references to reports that Joe diGenova, a lawyer for the Trump campaign, had said that Chris Krebs \u2014 a former federal cybersecurity official who vouched that the election was clean \u2014 should be shot.

    "article_text": "Trump Has Discussed With Advisers Pardons for His 3 Eldest Children and Giuliani President Trump has discussed with advisers whether to grant pre-emptive pardons to his children, to his son-in-law and to his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and talked with Mr. Giuliani about pardoning him as recently as last week, according to two people briefed on the matter. Mr. Trump has told others that he is concerned that a Biden Justice Department might seek retribution against the president by targeting the oldest three of his five children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump \u2014 as well as Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, a White House senior adviser. Donald Trump Jr. had been under investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, for contacts that the younger Mr. Trump had had with Russians offering damaging information on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign, but he was never charged. Mr. Kushner provided false information to federal authorities about his contacts with foreigners for his security clearance, but was given one anyway by the president. The nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s concern about any potential criminal exposure of Eric Trump or Ivanka Trump is unclear, although an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney into the Trump Organization has expanded to include tax write-offs on millions of dollars in consulting fees by the company, some of which appear to have gone to Ms. Trump. Presidential pardons, however, do not provide protection against state or local crimes. Mr. Giuliani\u2019s potential criminal exposure is also unclear, although he was under investigation as recently as this summer by federal prosecutors in Manhattan for his business dealings in Ukraine and his role in ousting the American ambassador there. The plot was at the heart of the impeachment of Mr. Trump. The speculation about pardon activity at the White House is churning furiously, underscoring how much the Trump administration has been dominated by investigations and criminal prosecutions of people in the president\u2019s orbit. Mr. Trump himself was singled out by federal prosecutors as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d in a court filing in the case that sent Michael D. Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, to prison. The discussions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani occurred as the former New York mayor has become one of the loudest voices pushing baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, which Mr. Trump still proclaims publicly that he won. Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime aides have refused to do his bidding to try to overturn an election that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. won by nearly seven million votes. But Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly thrust himself into the spotlight to cast doubt on the results, which has ingratiated him with the president. ABC News reported earlier on Tuesday that Mr. Trump was considering pardoning family members. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment. Mr. Giuliani did not respond to a message seeking comment, but after a version of this article was published online, he attacked it on Twitter and said it was false. Christiann\u00e9 L. Allen, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s spokeswoman, said Mr. Giuliani \u201ccannot comment on any discussions that he has with his client.\u201d And Mr. Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Robert Costello, said, \u201cHe\u2019s not concerned about this investigation because he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and that\u2019s been our position from Day 1.\u201d The Fox News host and Trump ally Sean Hannity said on Monday that given the animosity from Democrats directed at Mr. Trump, the president should consider pardoning his entire family. \u201cIf Biden ever became president, I\u2019d tell Trump pardon yourself and pardon your family,\u201d Mr. Hannity told his viewers. Mr. Trump is an avid consumer of Fox News, particularly Mr. Hannity\u2019s show. Such a broad pardon pre-empting any charge or conviction is highly unusual but does have precedent. In the most famous example, President Gerald R. Ford pardoned Richard M. Nixon for all of his actions as president. President George Washington pardoned plotters of the Whiskey Rebellion, shielding them from treason prosecutions. And President Jimmy Carter pardoned thousands of American men who illegally avoided the draft for the Vietnam War. Mr. Trump has wielded his clemency powers liberally in cases that resonate with him personally or for people who have a direct line to him through friends or family, while thousands of other cases await his review. A pardon for Mr. Giuliani is certain to prompt accusations that Mr. Trump has used his pardon power to obstruct investigations and insulate himself and his allies. Andrew A. Weissmann, a top prosecutor for Mr. Mueller, has said that Mr. Trump\u2019s dangling of pardons for his allies impeded their work. In July, the president commuted the sentence of his longtime adviser Roger J. Stone Jr., who had refused to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s investigators and was eventually convicted of seven felonies. Last week, Mr. Trump pardoned his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, who had backed out of his cooperation agreement with the special counsel\u2019s office for \u201cany and all possible offenses\u201d beyond the charge he had faced of lying to federal investigators. The Flynn pardon raised expectations that Mr. Trump would bestow clemency on other associates \u2014 like his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who refused to discuss matters from the 2016 election with prosecutors \u2014 in his final weeks in office. Mr. Giuliani has asked Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to pay him $20,000 a day for his work on trying to overturn the election, a figure that would make him among the most highly paid lawyers in the world. The staggering sum has stirred opposition among Mr. Trump\u2019s aides who worry that Mr. Giuliani has perpetuated the claims of election fraud in hopes of making as much money as possible. Mr. Giuliani has expressed concern that any federal investigations of his conduct that appear to have been dormant under the Trump administration could be revived in a Biden administration, according to people who have spoken to him. Legal experts say that if Mr. Trump wants to fully protect Mr. Giuliani from prosecution after he leaves office, the president would most likely have to detail in the language of the pardon what crimes he believed Mr. Giuliani had committed. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have since 2019 been investigating the role of Mr. Giuliani and two other associates in a wide-ranging pressure campaign directed at pushing the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, namely Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. President Trump\u00a0has discussed potential pardons\u00a0that could test the boundaries of his constitutional power to nullify criminal liability. Here\u2019s some clarity on his ability to pardon. The two Giuliani associates \u2014 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman \u2014 were arrested in October 2019 as they prepared to board a flight from Washington to Frankfurt with one-way tickets. They were charged with violating campaign finance laws as part of a complex scheme to undermine the former American ambassador in Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump believed should have been doing more to pressure the Ukrainians. Prosecutors in Manhattan continued to investigate Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role in the scheme over the past year, focusing on whether he was, in pushing to oust Ms. Yovanovitch, essentially double dipping: working not only for Mr. Trump but also for Ukrainian officials who wanted the ambassador gone for their own reasons, according to people briefed on the matter. It is a federal crime to try to influence the United States government at the request or direction of a foreign official without disclosing their involvement. Mr. Giuliani has said that he did nothing wrong and that he did not register as a foreign agent because he was acting on behalf of Mr. Trump, not any Ukrainians. Even as Mr. Trump maintains that the election was stolen and files lawsuits aimed at delaying its certification, his White House is preparing for the final stages of his presidency. The end of any administration typically prompts a wave of pardons, particularly when a term has been engulfed in controversy like Mr. Trump\u2019s, in which several people close to him became ensnared in federal investigations. \u201cThe pardon power has been used by many presidents in politically self-serving ways, whether it was George H.W. Bush or Clinton,\u201d said Jack L. Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School, citing how Mr. Bush pardoned six of his associates \u2014 including the former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger \u2014 for their role in the Iran-contra affair. \u201cPolitically, a pardon of Giuliani would be explosive,\u201d Mr. Goldsmith added, \u201cbut pardoning pals has been done before.\u201d Under previous administrations, presidents have largely granted pardons after they have gone through a formal review process at the Justice Department, where lawyers examined the convictions, discussed the ramifications of a potential pardon with prosecutors and then provided the White House with recommendations on how to proceed. On several occasions, Mr. Trump has gone against the Justice Department\u2019s recommendations and the advice of his own White House advisers, granting pardons to political allies and celebrities. When presidents have deviated from that process, scandals have occasionally occurred, especially after pardons in the last days of an administration. On the final day of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, he granted a pardon to Marc Rich, a wealthy financier and longtime Democratic donor who was considered a fugitive as he had fled the United States to avoid tax charges. Prosecutors in Manhattan investigated whether the pardon had been part of a quid pro quo, but no one was ever charged. At the time, Mr. Giuliani, who had helped bring criminal charges against Mr. Rich years earlier as a federal prosecutor, was deeply critical of the move, calling it \u201ca disgrace\u201d and declaring it \u201ca midnight pardon.\u201d No president has tried to grant someone a pardon for crimes they have not yet committed \u2014 essentially a prospective get-out-of-jail-free card \u2014 and legal experts say it is unlikely to hold any weight. In the case of Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation examined questions of whether his contacts during the 2016 election with WikiLeaks and Russians offering dirt on Mrs. Clinton amounted to campaign finance violations. Donald Trump Jr. was never interviewed by the special counsel\u2019s office and was never charged. In the case of Mr. Kushner, he omitted several significant contacts with foreigners when he filled out a form for his White House security clearance, including ones with the Russians offering damaging information on Mrs. Clinton during the campaign. Under federal law it is a crime to provide inaccurate or incomplete information on the background check documents for security clearances. In 2018, the White House counsel and chief of staff recommended that Mr. Kushner not receive a Top Secret security clearance because of issues that had been discovered during his background check. Over the objections of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, the president unilaterally granted Mr. Kushner the clearance. Ben Protess contributed reporting.",

    "article_text": "Mark Walker jumps into North Carolina Senate race, hoping to ward off Lara Trump and other potential rivals. WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Mark Walker announced on Tuesday that he would run for North Carolina\u2019s open Senate seat in 2022, kicking off what is likely to be a fierce Republican primary that could pit him against President Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law in a key swing state. In an interview, Mr. Walker, a former Baptist pastor from Greensboro, sought to frame himself as a \u201cbridge builder\u201d between Republicans and groups that the party had struggled to reach in recent years, particularly Black voters. \u201cI am trying to make the case you might want to select somebody who has the ability, or the history to work with people from all different communities,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a track record of going to places and accomplishing things that Republicans have not been able to do.\u201d Mr. Walker, 51, announced last year that he would not seek re-election after a court ordered North Carolina to redraw its congressional map, making his district much more Democratic. He had been mulling a Senate run for months after Senator Richard M. Burr, a fellow Republican, decided to retire. By entering the race just days after North Carolina certified its November elections, Mr. Walker was aiming to potentially box out other Republicans contemplating getting into the race. Other Republicans who are eyeing Mr. Burr\u2019s seat include Lara Trump, the wife of the president\u2019s son Eric Trump; Pat McCrory, the former governor; Representative George Holding, who is also retiring; and Dan Forest, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor who ran an unsuccessful campaign for governor this year. Ms. Trump has told associates that she is considering entering the contest, and her campaign could be a test of the family\u2019s political staying power once Mr. Trump leaves the White House. Despite stylistic differences, Mr. Walker has been a close ally of Mr. Trump in the House and would welcome his support in the Senate contest. Still, he offered a subtle dig on Tuesday at the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, who resides in Westchester County but has North Carolina roots. \u201cIf somebody wants to move to the state, legally they can do that, but it doesn\u2019t deter me,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cI have nothing to say but good things about their family.\u201d At least one potential contender has already passed on the race. Mark Meadows, another North Carolina conservative and Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, said last month he would not run for the seat as some expected. Democrats see the seat as one of their best pickup opportunities in 2022. Erica D. Smith, a state senator has already indicated she will run again, after losing the Democratic primary this year to Cal Cunningham, who fell short in his bid to unseat Senator Thom Tillis. Other possible candidates include Josh Stein, the state\u2019s attorney general, and Jeff Jackson, another state senator.",

Allen, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s spokeswoman, said Mr. Giuliani \u201ccannot comment on any discussions that he has with his client.\u201d And Mr. Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Robert Costello, said, \u201cHe\u2019s not concerned about this investigation because he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and that\u2019s been our position from Day 1.\u201d The Fox News host and Trump ally Sean Hannity said on Monday that given the animosity from Democrats directed at Mr. Trump, the president should consider pardoning his entire family. \u201cIf Biden ever became president, I\u2019d tell Trump pardon yourself and pardon your family,\u201d Mr. Hannity told his viewers. Mr. Trump is an avid consumer of Fox News, particularly Mr. Hannity\u2019s show. Such a broad pardon pre-empting any charge or conviction is highly unusual but does have precedent. In the most famous example, President Gerald R. Ford pardoned Richard M. Nixon for all of his actions as president. President George Washington pardoned plotters of the Whiskey Rebellion, shielding them from treason prosecutions. And President Jimmy Carter pardoned thousands of American men who illegally avoided the draft for the Vietnam War. Mr. Trump has wielded his clemency powers liberally in cases that resonate with him personally or for people who have a direct line to him through friends or family, while thousands of other cases await his review. A pardon for Mr. Giuliani is certain to prompt accusations that Mr. Trump has used his pardon power to obstruct investigations and insulate himself and his allies. Andrew A. Weissmann, a top prosecutor for Mr. Mueller, has said that Mr. Trump\u2019s dangling of pardons for his allies impeded their work. In July, the president commuted the sentence of his longtime adviser Roger J. Stone Jr., who had refused to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s investigators and was eventually convicted of seven felonies. Last week, Mr. Trump pardoned his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, who had backed out of his cooperation agreement with the special counsel\u2019s office for \u201cany and all possible offenses\u201d beyond the charge he had faced of lying to federal investigators. The Flynn pardon raised expectations that Mr. Trump would bestow clemency on other associates \u2014 like his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who refused to discuss matters from the 2016 election with prosecutors \u2014 in his final weeks in office. Mr. Giuliani has asked Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to pay him $20,000 a day for his work on trying to overturn the election, a figure that would make him among the most highly paid lawyers in the world. The staggering sum has stirred opposition among Mr. Trump\u2019s aides who worry that Mr. Giuliani has perpetuated the claims of election fraud in hopes of making as much money as possible. Mr. Giuliani has expressed concern that any federal investigations of his conduct that appear to have been dormant under the Trump administration could be revived in a Biden administration, according to people who have spoken to him. Legal experts say that if Mr. Trump wants to fully protect Mr. Giuliani from prosecution after he leaves office, the president would most likely have to detail in the language of the pardon what crimes he believed Mr. Giuliani had committed. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have since 2019 been investigating the role of Mr. Giuliani and two other associates in a wide-ranging pressure campaign directed at pushing the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, namely Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. President Trump\u00a0has discussed potential pardons\u00a0that could test the boundaries of his constitutional power to nullify criminal liability. Here\u2019s some clarity on his ability to pardon. The two Giuliani associates \u2014 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman \u2014 were arrested in October 2019 as they prepared to board a flight from Washington to Frankfurt with one-way tickets. They were charged with violating campaign finance laws as part of a complex scheme to undermine the former American ambassador in Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump believed should have been doing more to pressure the Ukrainians. Prosecutors in Manhattan continued to investigate Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role in the scheme over the past year, focusing on whether he was, in pushing to oust Ms. Yovanovitch, essentially double dipping: working not only for Mr. Trump but also for Ukrainian officials who wanted the ambassador gone for their own reasons, according to people briefed on the matter. It is a federal crime to try to influence the United States government at the request or direction of a foreign official without disclosing their involvement. Mr. Giuliani has said that he did nothing wrong and that he did not register as a foreign agent because he was acting on behalf of Mr. Trump, not any Ukrainians. Even as Mr. Trump maintains that the election was stolen and files lawsuits aimed at delaying its certification, his White House is preparing for the final stages of his presidency. The end of any administration typically prompts a wave of pardons, particularly when a term has been engulfed in controversy like Mr. Trump\u2019s, in which several people close to him became ensnared in federal investigations. \u201cThe pardon power has been used by many presidents in politically self-serving ways, whether it was George H.W. Bush or Clinton,\u201d said Jack L. Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School, citing how Mr. Bush pardoned six of his associates \u2014 including the former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger \u2014 for their role in the Iran-contra affair. \u201cPolitically, a pardon of Giuliani would be explosive,\u201d Mr. Goldsmith added, \u201cbut pardoning pals has been done before.\u201d Under previous administrations, presidents have largely granted pardons after they have gone through a formal review process at the Justice Department, where lawyers examined the convictions, discussed the ramifications of a potential pardon with prosecutors and then provided the White House with recommendations on how to proceed. On several occasions, Mr. Trump has gone against the Justice Department\u2019s recommendations and the advice of his own White House advisers, granting pardons to political allies and celebrities. When presidents have deviated from that process, scandals have occasionally occurred, especially after pardons in the last days of an administration. On the final day of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, he granted a pardon to Marc Rich, a wealthy financier and longtime Democratic donor who was considered a fugitive as he had fled the United States to avoid tax charges. Prosecutors in Manhattan investigated whether the pardon had been part of a quid pro quo, but no one was ever charged. At the time, Mr. Giuliani, who had helped bring criminal charges against Mr. Rich years earlier as a federal prosecutor, was deeply critical of the move, calling it \u201ca disgrace\u201d and declaring it \u201ca midnight pardon.\u201d No president has tried to grant someone a pardon for crimes they have not yet committed \u2014 essentially a prospective get-out-of-jail-free card \u2014 and legal experts say it is unlikely to hold any weight. In the case of Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation examined questions of whether his contacts during the 2016 election with WikiLeaks and Russians offering dirt on Mrs. Clinton amounted to campaign finance violations. Donald Trump Jr. was never interviewed by the special counsel\u2019s office and was never charged. In the case of Mr. Kushner, he omitted several significant contacts with foreigners when he filled out a form for his White House security clearance, including ones with the Russians offering damaging information on Mrs. Clinton during the campaign. Under federal law it is a crime to provide inaccurate or incomplete information on the background check documents for security clearances. In 2018, the White House counsel and chief of staff recommended that Mr. Kushner not receive a Top Secret security clearance because of issues that had been discovered during his background check. Over the objections of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, the president unilaterally granted Mr. Kushner the clearance. Ben Protess contributed reporting.",

    "article_text": "Biden introduces his economic team at a moment of big risks. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. introduced key members of his economic team on Tuesday, as he prepares to assume the White House at a moment when the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is slowing and millions remain out of work. Mr. Biden, speaking at an event in Delaware, said he was building \u201ca first-rate team that\u2019s going to get us through this ongoing economic crisis.\u201d The president-elect called on Congress to pass a \u201crobust\u201d rescue package to help households, businesses and state and local governments, saying many communities are \u201cteetering on the edge.\u201d Mr. Biden is poised to enter the White House at a time of national crisis amid the worsening virus outbreak. The Department of Labor and Department of Commerce have reported an increase in applications for state jobless benefits and a decrease in personal income. Coronavirus cases have soared in recent weeks, a development that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell called \u201cconcerning\u201d in testimony before lawmakers on Tuesday, saying it \u201ccould prove challenging in the next few months.\u201d In a sign of how critical a role economic policy will play in the Biden administration, the President-elect said he was returning the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers to a cabinet-level position. President Trump had demoted the C.E.A. chair during his administration. Mr. Biden has chosen Cecilia Rouse to lead the Council of Economic Advisers; she would be the first Black woman in the role. Ms. Rouse is a Princeton economist who worked on the Council of Economic Advisers during part of the Obama era and on the White House\u2019s National Economic Council during the Clinton administration. Mr. Biden has warned of a \u201cvery dark winter\u201d ahead and called on Congress to pass relief to help workers, businesses, and state and local governments. Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers are preparing for what could be another economic downturn in early 2021. But another economic stimulus package has languished in Congress, where Democrats and Republicans have been unable to reach a deal, though leaders of both parties have called for compromise in recent days. A bipartisan group of senators rolled out a potential compromise plan on Tuesday morning that appeared to fit the contours of what Mr. Biden, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, have said must frame any stimulus deal in Washington. They include additional aid to the unemployed and small businesses, along with money to help state and local governments patch budget holes that have been ripped open during the pandemic. Tuesday\u2019s slate of nominees and appointees includes several women in top economic roles. The selections, markedly different from Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, which has been overwhelmingly white and male, follow Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign promise to build an administration that looks like America. His pick for the Office of Management and Budget \u2014 Neera Tanden, the chief executive of the Center for American Progress \u2014 would be the first Indian-American to lead the office if confirmed. Mr. Biden also selected Janet L. Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, to be his Treasury Secretary. If confirmed, she would be the first woman to fill the position. Ms. Tanden has met immediate resistance from Republican senators who have criticized her for attacking Republicans publicly, including on her Twitter feed. She previewed the group\u2019s likely emphasis on personal stories in a Twitter post on Monday, after her nomination was announced: \u201cAfter my parents were divorced when I was young, my mother relied on public food and housing programs to get by,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow, I\u2019m being nominated to help ensure those programs are secure, and ensure families like mine can live with dignity.\u201d Mr. Biden also announced his picks for deputy treasury secretary, Adewale Adeyemo, and members of the Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey. Mr. Adeyemo served as a senior international economic adviser under former President Barack Obama, and Mr. Bernstein was Mr. Biden\u2019s first chief economist when he was vice president. Ms. Boushey, a top policy adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2016, leads the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank focused on inequality. The introductions follow a similar event last week, when Mr. Biden publicly introduced members of his foreign policy and national security team.",

    "article_text": "As uncertainty grows, Congress kick-starts stimulus talks. The country\u2019s economy, like the nation\u2019s politics, is queasily suspended between the Trump and Biden administrations \u2014 at a moment when the rampaging pandemic has prompted deep concerns over the strength, timing and even likelihood of a possible recovery next year. On Tuesday, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. tried to inject a sense of urgency \u2014 and stability \u2014 into a chaotic postelection environment by formally introducing his economic team, whose governing philosophy marks a stark departure from President Trump\u2019s low-tax, low-regulation approach. \u201cLet\u2019s begin the work to heal, to unite, to rebuild an economy for all Americans,\u201d Mr. Biden said at an event in Wilmington, Del. The new team, led by Mr. Biden\u2019s pick for Treasury Secretary, Janet L. Yellen, the former Fed chair, will emphasize the need to immediately help households and businesses stay afloat amid the pandemic through the use of emergency appropriations and other forms of federal assistance, Biden aides have said. During his remarks, Mr. Biden directly appealed to senators who will vote on the confirmations of his cabinet members and who are likely to oppose some of his picks. \u201cTo the United States Senate, I hope those outstanding, these outstanding nominees receive a prompt hearing and that we will be able to work across the aisle in good faith and move forward as one country,\u201d said Mr. Biden as he introduced his nominees including Neera Tanden, the combative head of a liberal think tank who is one choice likely to face some opposition. Earlier in the day, current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell backed that approach, warning Congress that \u201cthe outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain\u201d without an effort to bridge the dangerous transition by limiting the spread of the virus and supporting the economy. Mr. Trump\u2019s departing Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, offered a much less dire assessment of the economy in his prepared remarks before the Senate Banking Committee. But there were signs that the two sides were attempting to bridge the gap. Mr. Mnuchin told reporters he was planning to reach out to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to discuss negotiations over another virus relief package. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin III, a Democrat from West Virginia, unveiled the blueprint for a $900 billion stopgap stimulus package later in the day. The plan would provide $300 a week in federal unemployment benefits for 18 weeks, half of what Democrats have sought, and it includes $160 billion in funding for state and local governments, much less than the $500 billion Democrats had previously proposed, which congressional Republicans and the White House had firmly rejected. In his testimony, Mr. Mnuchin proposed spending an additional $300 billion on relief \u2014 a move that was instantly attacked as insufficient by Democratic members of the panel. \u201cI continue to believe that a targeted fiscal package is the most appropriate federal response,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said on Tuesday. \u201cThe administration is standing ready to support Congress in this effort to help American workers and small businesses.\u201d Yet even as most congressional Republicans refuse to publicly acknowledge Mr. Biden\u2019s victory, many in the party are starting to privately adjust to negotiating with a Biden team whose coordinated activity represents a sharp break from Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s approach that had often involved back-room diplomacy with Democrats beyond the reach of his volatile boss.",

I cannot find tolerance for the \u201cother side.\u201d To date, however, I\u2019ve just kept quiet and avoided the subject with people I know are beyond convincing. Is that adequate? Mimi B. Osiason In a democracy, we the people are supposed to be guiding the ship of state together. To do that, we need to be able to talk to one another, which suggests that engagement, rather than confrontation, can be a civic act. It can also be an act of friendship, because one thing we want to do is to save our friends from making serious mistakes. Just bear in mind that listening in these circumstances is as important as talking. The polarized state of our politics, alas, means that people are so taken up with their political identities that they\u2019re unable or unwilling to consider the views of those outside their political tribe. Conversations on these topics tend to turn up the temperature while dimming the lights. And, given your principles, it\u2019s easy to assume that your Trump-loving friends are morally defective \u2014 that they don\u2019t take cruelty, xenophobia, intemperance, narcissism and dishonesty with due seriousness. Perhaps that\u2019s the case. But perhaps the gulf between you and these friends arises from differences in your epistemic capacities \u2014 the ability to gain reliable information. Our beliefs depend not just on our own brains but also on the social worlds we live in. One way of capturing this truth is what some philosophers have called the extended-mind hypothesis: Our minds don\u2019t simply repose between our ears (the argument goes) but extend into the world around us, a world that may or may not include Fox News, Parler, talk radio, a voluble workplace colleague who has always seemed marvelously in the know, filtered Twitter feeds and the like. What\u2019s obvious is that people can be epistemically disadvantaged by gaining their beliefs from social networks that are radically unreliable. We get many of our false beliefs in the same way we get true ones: by listening to the views of people we trust. You can be partially responsible for being in an unreliable network if there are signs that something is wrong and you don\u2019t examine the possibility that it\u2019s misleading you. But the misjudgment here may not reflect bad moral values. Once the fog of political warfare that surrounds an election has cleared, we could discover that most of our fellow citizens are not irredeemably indifferent to Trump\u2019s evident vices; that whatever explains their attachment to the president, it is not that they repudiate the values he does not respect. Our tribal prejudices are at their worst in moments like these. Let\u2019s hope we can recover some measure of equilibrium and move, however stumblingly, toward a modus vivendi that entails working to see the best in one another and not just the worst. Only if we learn to overcome our fiercest prejudices can we take up the business of steering the ship of state as a people united despite our disagreements. I am applying to medical school, and on certain applications there is a question asking applicants to describe whether they identify as part of certain minority communities, including the L.G.B.T.Q. community. I have always publicly identified as heterosexual, yet I have bisexual tendencies that I\u2019ve never acted on or told anyone about. But I know that identifying myself as bisexual will diversify me as an applicant and perhaps increase my chances of acceptance. Does privately questioning my own sexuality qualify me as part of the L.G.B.T.Q. community? Or must I be out as bisexual in order to put it down on my application? Would I be taking away opportunities from students whose L.G.B.T.Q. status is more central to their identities? Name Withheld The Association of American Medical Colleges, which has worked with its member medical schools to design the application form they use, speaks of the importance of securing access to underrepresented minorities and specifies that \u201cunderrepresented in medicine means those racial and ethnic populations that are underrepresented in the medical profession relative to their numbers in the general population.\u201d I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll get a bump up for being bisexual, notionally or actually. Still, because this question evidently invites personal comments, you can, if you wish, explain your situation just as you have here and let the institution decide. I work as the executive director of a nonprofit organization. Like so many, we are struggling through the pandemic with fewer resources, fewer staff members and even less certainty about the future. In the spring, I implemented belt-tightening with all our staff members, beginning with my own salary. I\u2019ve taken a sizable cut because of base-salary reduction and a partial furlough. Recently, a board member and his wife dropped by my office with a beautiful flower arrangement with an envelope attached, containing a wonderful note of encouragement and several thousand dollars in cash. This board member does not have a conflict of interest, is not expecting a better board position \u2014 no ulterior motive. They\u2019re well off and wanted to recognize my work. But my conscience is on high alert. A gift only for me when everyone here is working hard and is paid less than me to begin with? I feel conflicted about the gift and am strongly considering donating it to the organization.  At the same time, I want to honor the intentions behind this very kind gesture. Our organization does not have a policy against receiving gifts, and the money would be a help to me and my family. Please help me sort through what to do. Name Withheld A gift of this sort can result in your having a changed relationship with this donor and trustee; it is now, in a very personal way, a relationship between benefactor and beneficiary. Your donors\u2019 gifts contribute to your salary already, of course, but that\u2019s mediated by the formal structures of the institution and the law. A direct gift of this kind has a different meaning. It was doubtless meant to convey gratitude and respect, but it\u2019s also, at least potentially, a way of turning you into a personal prot\u00e9g\u00e9. So you need to think about what accepting the gift means for your future interactions with this person. Assuming you\u2019re OK with a somewhat changed relationship, you\u2019re still left to contend with the issue you raise about equity. Is it fair that this gift goes to you and not to other staff members who could use it even more? Because board members typically have personal relationships only with senior management, they are not likely to have the kinds of bonds with the rest of the staff that lead to this kind of generosity. The truth is that philanthropic gifts generally aren\u2019t based on need; there\u2019s almost always a more deserving recipient. The money you give to the local art museum is money that could vaccinate children and save lives in a poor country far away. Whatever the case is for giving money to the museum in those circumstances, it can\u2019t be that the museum has the greater need. That philanthropy is mostly not guided by a pure calculus of utility is one reason for having a public system to address the basic needs of all citizens. Still, a gift is a gift, and \u2014 if you choose to accept it \u2014 you are free to do with it what you will. Your scruples suggest that spending the money on your own family may not reflect your moral priorities. So, knowing the challenges facing your less well-off employees, you could, as you say, use the money to help the organization. Because your gift will be tax-deductible, it\u2019s possible that some part of the money may, in fact, end up in your pocket.",

    "article_text": "Donald Trump Was My Fitspo My birthday fell on Election Day 2016. The giant carrot cake sat uncut at our watch party as we saw Ohio flash red. Then Florida. Sometime around North Carolina, my friends started mumbling the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d song. I blew out the candles, knowing the electoral map would deny me my wish. For days after, I could not get Donald Trump out of my mind. It was not a matter of party politics; it was that this future president had run on a platform that seemed opposed to the very idea of me: a woman, a person of color, a child of immigrants. I was stressed, distressed \u2014 angry. Then I started thinking about all my annoyingly upbeat runner friends who over the years professed that what they loved most about the sport was how it just \u201cclears your head.\u201d I\u2019d never really understood it. My whole life I\u2019d scoffed at vigorous exercise. At the school I attended, varsity letters were handed out for Model United Nations as often as they were for sports (I went the nerdier route). My mother still calls sneakers \u201cP.E. shoes\u201d because she purchased them only for our middle school physical education classes. Thanks to her, I had a decent metabolism and a great ineptitude for anything remotely athletic. The Monday after Donald Trump\u2019s election, that changed. With few other options to escape my own mind, I put on a pair of P.E. shoes I\u2019d bought two years earlier, which were still good as new. And I entered the \u201cred room\u201d \u2014 a boutique fitness arena otherwise known as Barry\u2019s Bootcamp. It was like nothing I\u2019d ever seen: nightclub lighting, blaring music, treadmills and a terrifying wall of dumbbells the size of my head. The class was full of people who looked like athletes or models or both, contorting their bodies into positions named after sharp objects like \u201cjackknives.\u201d On Tread No. 18, facing a mirrored wall, I sprinted toward an aspirational reflection of myself: determined, radiant with sweat, and no longer moping on my couch. I was propelled by pop hits remixed at 135 beats per minute and the chants of a muscular preacher stationed at Floor Bench No. 9. Apparently, I could \u201cdo anything for 30 seconds.\u201d The coach continued to preach, \u201cWe all have the power to leave behind whatever it is that holds us back!\u201d I believed him. I panted harder and found a second wind in my quest to leave behind Donald Trump. For that one hour \u2014 for the first time in 5 days 22 hours and 21 minutes \u2014 I was free of him. It was the beginning of a bizarre transformation inspired by a septuagenarian president whose preferred workout is typing on Twitter, playing a round of golf and raising the remote to summon his own image on the TV screen. Not your standard Instagram #fitspo. The red room at Barry\u2019s became my church. I started going every week, then every other day, and sometimes more. Eventually I added other fitness classes to the rotation: Megaformer Pilates; a circuit session where we pushed and pulled sleds like Rocky Balboa; and even a workout in which we wore high-tech skin suits designed to stimulate muscle groups with electrical pulses as we squatted and lunged around a studio in TriBeCa. When fitness classes shut down in the pandemic, I bought myself resistance bands and a mini-trampoline. I bounced through \u201crebounder\u201d cardio at home while cursing the president\u2019s lies about the coronavirus and the damage he was allowing to unfold in our nation. Exercise took the sadness and anger and powerlessness I felt about these four years and fueled it into something productive. It made me healthier than I\u2019d ever been. In the process, I realized I could change something: myself. So I started changing other things too. I volunteered more, I focused on producing film and TV projects that had some social purpose, and eventually I started to work at The Times. This president unintentionally changed many of us. Maybe you, like me, were one of the millions of voters who had skipped midterm elections but turned out in 2018. Maybe you, moved by his unapologetic abuse of women, finally came forward with a story from your past and said \u201cme too.\u201d Maybe he convinced you, Republican or Democrat, to run for office. To be a better dad. To fact-check your opinions. To subscribe to a newspaper. Or even to learn about Maricopa County, Arizona. Of course, civic engagement and sweating it out at the gym are not the same things. But they are connected. When we felt powerless to change the course of events unfolding in our nation\u2019s capital, we could at least control how we spend our own lives. I\u2019m sure many of us would give anything to erase his reign (I\u2019d certainly give up all the burpees, push-ups and that one time I embarrassingly fell on the treadmill going 11 miles per hour). Yet any bright spots we\u2019ve found during his presidency continue to glow. I wonder what will happen once he\u2019s gone. Will all that angry motivation melt away, leaving us complacent? Will it persist because even after four years of Donald Trump\u2019s supposed leadership, this election was tighter than we\u2019d expected? Or will the action and activism he unintentionally pushed us toward simply hang around like good habits? When it comes to my own workout routine, I think I\u2019ll keep it going. This time not for Donald Trump, but for myself. It turns out that my annoying runner friends were onto something. Exercise gave me a clarity of mind and purpose. It made me realize that in all that despair, I could find the strength to do things that once felt impossible. Not just for 30 seconds, but for four years. Maybe even for a lifetime.

    "article_text": "Scott Atlas, a Trump Coronavirus Adviser, Resigns WASHINGTON \u2014 Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the former Stanford University radiologist who espoused controversial theories and rankled government scientists while advising President Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, resigned his White House position on Monday. The move was not entirely unexpected. Dr. Atlas joined the White House in August as a special government employee for a limited term after he caught Mr. Trump\u2019s eye with his frequent appearances on Fox News over the summer. Dr. Atlas\u2019s term was set to expire this week. \u201cI worked hard with a singular focus \u2014 to save lives and help Americans through this pandemic,\u201d Dr. Atlas wrote in a letter that he posted Monday night on Twitter, adding, \u201cI always relied on the latest science and evidence, without any political consideration or influence.\u201d Fox News earlier reported his resignation. Honored to have served @realDonaldTrump and the American people during these difficult times. pic.twitter.com/xT1hRoYBMh But some of Dr. Atlas\u2019s Trump administration colleagues would most likely contradict that assessment, citing views starkly different from those put forth by officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by other government scientists. Dr. Atlas has argued, for example, that the science of mask wearing is uncertain and that children cannot spread the coronavirus. Even more contentious was his libertarian vision of the role of the government in the pandemic. In Dr. Atlas\u2019s view, the government\u2019s job was not to stamp out the virus but simply to protect its most vulnerable citizens as Covid-19 took its course. His argument was that most people infected with the coronavirus would not get seriously ill, and at some point, enough people would have antibodies from Covid-19 to deprive the virus of carriers \u2014 so-called herd immunity. Dr. Atlas also railed against anything that smacked of a lockdown or business closure. \u201cProtect the high-risk; open schools, society,\u201d he tweeted in October. \u201cAlternative? Confine healthy people, restrict business, close schools\u2026kills people, destroys families, sacrifices kids. #RationalThinking.\u201d Public health experts were appalled and warned that his ideas were dangerous and would have disastrous results. But that did not stop Dr. Atlas. In mid-November, he called on people in Michigan to \u201crise up\u201d against coronavirus restrictions. The state\u2019s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who had faced death threats and a thwarted kidnapping attempt over the restrictions, denounced him as \u201cincredibly reckless.\u201d But in his resignation letter and the accompanying tweet, Dr. Atlas defended himself. \u201cWe also identified and illuminated early on the harms of prolonged lockdowns, including that they create massive physical health losses and psychological distress, destroy families and damage our children,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd more and more,\u201d he added, \u201cthe relatively low risk to children of serious harms from the infection, the less frequent spread from children, the presence of immunologic protection beyond that shown by antibody testing, and the severe harms from closing schools and society are all being acknowledged.\u201d Inside the administration, Dr. Atlas clashed in particular with Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease specialist, and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator. While Dr. Atlas was playing down the necessity of wearing masks, Dr. Birx was traveling the country preaching the opposite. She implored governors and public health officials in hard-hit states to take more aggressive steps. The two also clashed repeatedly in private. But Dr. Atlas\u2019s disagreements with Dr. Fauci were more visceral \u2014 and more public. After the election, Dr. Atlas accused Dr. Fauci of being a \u201cpolitical animal\u201d who changed his assessment of the threat of the pandemic after it became clear that Mr. Trump had lost. Dr. Fauci replied in kind. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything against Dr. Atlas as a person, but I totally disagree with the stand he takes,\u201d he said recently on the \u201cToday\u201d show on NBC, after Dr. Atlas\u2019s comments about Michigan. \u201cI just do, period.\u201d But Dr. Atlas had the ear of the one person who mattered: Mr. Trump. \u201cHe has many great ideas,\u201d the president told reporters in August at a White House briefing, with Dr. Atlas seated feet away. \u201cAnd he thinks what we\u2019ve done is really good, and now we\u2019ll take it to a new level.\u201d",

    "article_text": "The White House Christmas Decorations Look Strikingly Normal The first lady has overseen holiday decorations at the White House since 1961, when Jacqueline Kennedy hung ornaments of toys, birds and angels themed to \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d ballet on a Christmas tree in the Blue Room. This year was no different. In a one-minute video posted to Twitter on Monday, Melania Trump unveiled this year\u2019s theme, \u201cAmerica the Beautiful,\u201d which she translated as green trees decorated with red, gold and silver ornaments and white lights, a style so traditional that it could grace the cover of Martha Stewart Living. The East Colonnade this year features simple black urns holding plumes of foliage and greenery from each state and territory. During this special time of the year, I am delighted to share \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d and pay tribute to the majesty of our great Nation. Together, we celebrate this land we are all proud to call home. #WHChristmas pic.twitter.com/fdZmB3rdXL The bold aesthetic choices that drew so much flak and snarky memes in Christmases past are noticeably absent. There are no blood-red trees, as there were in 2018, which various news outlets called \u201ccreepy\u201d and \u201cdeeply haunted.\u201d There is nothing akin to the icy, underlit branches of 2017 that turned the East Colonnade into what some likened to a barren, dystopian landscape. This year, a toy train \u2014 the \u201cWhite House Express\u201d \u2014 circles a wreath placed on a center table. Crafty ornaments bear the names of children from Maryland, Michigan and the Northern Mariana Islands. Other decorations celebrate \u201cpioneers for gender equality,\u201d as the first lady\u2019s office put it, including the artist Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. This is Mrs. Trump\u2019s last Christmas at the White House as first lady, and if her tree trimmings seem unimpeachable by design, that may be the point. She received an early lump of coal in her stocking in September, when her former adviser Stephanie Winston Wolkoff published a tell-all memoir, \u201cMelania and Me.\u201d Among the newsworthy comments Mrs. Trump made in the book \u2014 and in secretly recorded conversations Ms. Winston Wolkoff released \u2014 was her complaint about the chore of the holidays, and her negative press coverage compared to her predecessor, Michelle Obama. Mrs. Trump was heard on the recordings delivering a profanity-laced rant about \u201cChristmas stuff\u201d and decorations. \u201cBut I need to do it, right?\u201d she added. Mrs. Trump has also been tasked with spreading cheer at a time when daily deaths from Covid-19 are approaching tallies not seen since the spring and many Americans are canceling holiday plans out of fear of spreading the virus. Her decorations, including a snow-covered mini hospital and ornaments of a garbage truck, a nurse\u2019s hat and a lab coat, nod to the pandemic and essential workers. Early reviews of the decorations have been charitable. CNN highlighted a tree in the Vermeil Room with ornaments featuring a portrait of President John F. Kennedy and sailboats, and another tree in the library celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, noting, \u201cSignificant thought and detail went into the Americana decorations.\u201d The Independent wrote: \u201cMs. Trump and an army of volunteers put together a warmer, less edgy display that runs throughout the Executive Mansion.\u201d Even outlets that have been harshly critical of Mrs. Trump\u2019s take on the holidays couldn\u2019t work up the energy this year. Consider this tepid headline from Mashable: \u201cMelania Trump unveils her final White House Christmas decorations and they\u2019re fine.\u201d The website gave grudging respect to Mrs. Trump, and seemed almost disappointed not to carry on the recent holiday tradition, undertaken by much of the media, of skewering the White House Christmas design choices. \u201cPlaying it safe is probably a good strategy this year,\u201d the article said. \u201cThis theme is harder to meme, for sure.\u201d",

President Trump on Monday morning inaccurately described Georgia\u2019s vote counting process and implausibly urged the state\u2019s Republican governor to \u201coverrule\u201d its Republican secretary of state. Why won\u2019t Governor @BrianKempGA, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes. It will be a \u201cgoldmine\u201d of fraud, and we will easily WIN the state.... The tweet was the latest of Mr. Trump\u2019s continuing assault on election results in Georgia and its top Republican officials, which has ignited an intraparty feud in the state. Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia does not have the authority to do what Mr. Trump is suggesting. Moreover, signature verification is already part of the vote counting process. When absentee ballots are received, Georgia\u2019s election officials verify the signature on the envelopes. The ballots and envelopes are then separated to protect privacy, so rechecking the envelopes during a recount would be meaningless. \u201cGeorgia law prohibits the governor from interfering in elections. The secretary of state, who is an elected constitutional officer, has oversight over elections that cannot be overridden by executive order,\u201d a spokesman for Mr. Kemp told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The notion that \u201cthe governor has inherent executive authority to suspend or investigate or somehow interfere with this process \u2014 that\u2019s just not true,\u201d said Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University. \u201cThere is no plausible case here whatsoever.\u201d Unlike the federal government, Georgia does not have a unitary executive and its governor and secretary of state have separate duties. Even the governor\u2019s emergency powers are limited. Mr. Kreis said that Georgia\u2019s code was \u201cvery clear\u201d on the kinds of things a governor can do in a state of emergency. Mr. Kemp can move resources and funds and enact temporary measures, Mr. Kreis said, but \u201che does not have the authority to expressly interfere with elections.\u201d Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, continued to push back on Mr. Trump\u2019s and his allies\u2019 baseless claims of mass voter fraud in a news conference on Monday. \u201cThe truth matters, especially around election administration,\u201d Mr. Raffensperger said. \u201cThere are those who exploit the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation and frankly, they\u2019re misleading the president as well, apparently.\u201d",

    "first_p": "On Monday, the Supreme Court heard arguments on a question that goes to the heart of American democracy: Must the government count everyone living in the country, citizens or not, in the census totals that the House of Representatives uses to reallocate its 435 seats among the states?",
    "article_text": "A Census Case That Goes to the Heart of American Democracy On Monday, the Supreme Court heard arguments on a question that goes to the heart of American democracy: Must the government count everyone living in the country, citizens or not, in the census totals that the House of Representatives uses to reallocate its 435 seats among the states? For more than two centuries, the answer has been \u201cyes.\u201d Both Article 1 of the Constitution and the 14th Amendment require that House seats be allotted according to \u201cthe whole number\u201d of persons in each state. That phrase has long been read to include all the nation\u2019s residents, whether American citizens, foreigners admitted here on visas or immigrants with no documents at all. But President Trump signaled in a memorandum this summer that he intended to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the 2020 census totals that he hoped to send to the House next year for use in reapportionment. Federal courts have ruled in three separate lawsuits that Mr. Trump lacks that authority, saying in one case that the question was not even close. But the Supreme Court will have the final say. Here\u2019s a rundown of some of the basics behind the issue: First and foremost, the allocation of political power. No precise count of unauthorized immigrants exists. Mr. Trump has ordered the Census Bureau to come up with an estimate, but many experts put the number at about 11 million. Many are concentrated in states with large immigrant populations, such as New York and Texas, and in states like California and Florida where undocumented immigrants also are in demand for farm work. Some of those states and a few others could lose House seats if unauthorized immigrants were excluded from census totals. Conversely, some states with few unauthorized immigrants could pick up those seats. Alabama, for example, appears set to lose one of its seven House seats in the next reapportionment; the state is arguing in a separate lawsuit that undocumented immigrants are illegally depriving its citizens of fair representation. Many experts feel that restricting the count to citizens would tend to benefit states that are rural and Republican at the expense of ones that are urban and Democratic. But the Republican Party\u2019s gains probably would be small, most say, given that big Republican states like Texas would be among those that could be affected by the change. The Justice Department argues that federal law gives the president discretion to make policy judgments about whom the census counts. That discretion includes setting the definition of an \u201cinhabitant\u201d or \u201cusual resident\u201d of the United States, two terms that have historically been used to describe people who qualify to be counted in a census. The president\u2019s lawyers say federal law gives \u201cvirtually unfettered discretion\u201d to the Commerce Department \u2014 the federal agency that oversees the Census Bureau \u2014 to decide what data is used in counting individual residents of states. Opponents of the president\u2019s plan say 230 years of history are on their side. Noncitizens have been counted in every census \u2014 and used in every reapportionment of the House \u2014 since the very first census was conducted in 1790. In the nation\u2019s early history, a substantial share of the population had migrated from other countries, and for many decades thereafter, some states actively recruited foreigners to provide labor and boost political representation. The framers of the Constitution elected to exclude some people from being counted \u2014 specifying \u201cIndians not taxed\u201d and, most notoriously, deciding to count someone who was enslaved as three-fifths of a person \u2014 but left noncitizens intact. The drafters of the 14th Amendment debated whether to count all immigrants for apportionment purposes, and elected in the end to do so. The opponents also say that the Constitution explicitly requires that the decennial census be used for reapportionment, and that Mr. Trump has no authority to deduct unauthorized immigrants from that census before sending population totals to the House. Three courts \u2014 in New York, Maryland and California \u2014 have ruled against the White House on varying grounds and in some cases barred the Commerce Department from sending a count of unauthorized immigrants to the White House. The California court ruled that excluding noncitizens violated both federal law and the Constitution. In New York, a panel of three judges, two appointed by President George W. Bush and one by President Barack Obama, said unanimously that \u201cthe merits of the parties\u2019 dispute are not particularly close or complicated.\u201d The panel said federal law required the government to produce a single set of population figures for reapportionment, making Mr. Trump\u2019s plan for a separate estimate of unauthorized immigrants moot. The judges also said that \u201cso long as they reside in the United States, illegal aliens qualify as \u2018persons\u2019 in a \u2018state\u2019 as Congress used those words.\u201d Because of that, the judges said, there was no need to take up the question of whether the president\u2019s plan also violated the Constitution. It would be extremely hard, if only because many of them are trying their best to avoid being seen for fear of deportation. The Trump administration had ordered the Census Bureau to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census in an attempt to come up with a tally, but the Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the Commerce Department had failed to offer a plausible explanation of why the question was needed. On the president\u2019s order, a Census Bureau task force is working to provide a count anyway, mostly by sifting through federal and state records that show conclusively who is a citizen \u2014 and by implication, who is not. A handful of records, such as compilations of people marked for deportation, do identify people who are in the county illegally, but those tallies are a small fraction of the entire population of unauthorized immigrants. It appears unlikely that the bureau will produce an estimate of unauthorized immigrants by the Dec. 31 statutory deadline for sending population totals to the White House. Indeed, Census Bureau officials told the Commerce Department this month that the 2020 census itself could not be completed until after Mr. Trump leaves office on Jan. 20. The bureau\u2019s experts nevertheless are racing to complete a count of unauthorized immigrants for delivery to Mr. Trump in early or mid-January.",

    "article_text": "\u2018Trump Is Better\u2019: In Asia, Pro-Democracy Forces Worry About Biden BANGKOK \u2014 A dissident once branded Enemy No. 1 by the Chinese Communist Party is spreading conspiracy theories about the American presidential election. Pro-democracy campaigners from Hong Kong are championing President Trump\u2019s claims of an electoral victory. Human rights activists and religious leaders in Vietnam and Myanmar are expressing reservations about President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s ability to keep authoritarians in check. It might seem counterintuitive that Asian defenders of democracy are among the most ardent supporters of Mr. Trump, who has declared his friendship with Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un of North Korea. But it is precisely Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to flout diplomatic protocol, abandon international accords and keep his opponents off-balance that have earned him plaudits as a leader strong enough to stand up to dictators and defend democratic ideals overseas, even if he has been criticized as diminishing them at home. As President-elect Biden assembles his foreign-policy team, prominent human rights activists across Asia are worried about his desire for the United States to hew again to international norms. They believe that Mr. Biden, like former President Barack Obama, will pursue accommodation rather than confrontation in the face of China\u2019s assertive moves. And their pro-Trump views have been cemented by online misinformation, often delivered by dubious news sources, that Mr. Biden is working in tandem with communists or is a closet socialist sympathizer. \u201cBiden is president, and it\u2019s like having Xi Jinping sitting in the White House,\u201d said Elmer Yuen, a Hong Kong entrepreneur who has posted YouTube videos criticizing the Chinese Communist Party, or C.C.P. \u201cHe wants to coexist with China, and whoever coexists with the C.C.P. loses.\u201d With Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential tenure in its twilight, these activists are calling for the administration to make a final stand against Asian autocrats, similar to a last-ditch effort to expand the border wall with Mexico. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took a five-nation swing through Asia in October in which he abandoned politesse and described the Chinese government as a \u201cpredator,\u201d \u201clawless and threatening,\u201d and \u201cthe gravest threat to the future of religious freedom.\u201d The tour was meant as a counterweight to China in a region where Beijing\u2019s dollar diplomacy has bought significant influence. Earlier this month, Lobsang Sangay became the first head of the Tibetan government-in-exile to visit the White House; the provocative invite infuriated Beijing, which considers Mr. Sangay to be a separatist. In June, Mr. Pompeo attended a virtual gathering with the Hong Kong democracy leader Joshua Wong and President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, both of whom are loathed by the Chinese government. Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity is particularly enduring among Christians, such as Chinese-born legal scholars chafing against Communism\u2019s atheist core and ethnic minority activists in Southeast Asia. Mr. Pompeo and other Trump administration officials, they believe, have been fulfilling a faith-based mission overseas. Last year, Mr. Trump met in the White House with a group of religious leaders from across the world, including Hkalam Samson, the president of the Kachin Baptist Convention, which represents the persecuted Christian Kachin minority in Myanmar. \u201cMy experience in the White House, when I was given one minute to speak out about the Kachin, meant a lot, and it also meant that Trump cares about us,\u201d Mr. Samson said. \u201cTrump is better for the Kachin than Biden.\u201d Skepticism for Mr. Biden extends to those fighting for secular political rights as well. The president-elect\u2019s embrace of diplomatic custom will not work when only one side is playing fairly, they say. \u201cFor Biden\u2019s policies toward China, the part about making China play by the international rules, I think, is very hollow,\u201d said Wang Dan, who helped lead the 1989 Tiananmen protests as a university student. \u201cAs we know, the Chinese Communist Party hardly abides by international rules.\u201d \u201cThe United States must realize that there will be no improvements on human rights issues in China if there is no regime change,\u201d Mr. Wang added. He has continued to question Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral loss, baseless claims shared by other prominent Chinese-born dissidents. But others within the community, particularly in Hong Kong and China, said that backing Mr. Trump was hypocritical at best and dangerous at worst. \u201cTrump\u2019s human rights record \u2014 what he does to migrant children, the Muslim ban, white supremacy, alternative truth \u2014 removes him from my support, but this is apparently not the popular attitude among many dissidents in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan,\u201d said Badiucao, a China-born political artist who now lives in self-exile in Australia. Mr. Badiucao, who is known by a pseudonym to protect his family in China, has skirmished online with Mr. Wang and other well-known dissidents and has made the scuffle a topic for his art. \u201cThese guys are utilitarian, and they believe that if Trump is waging war against the C.C.P. then he\u2019s right for them,\u201d Mr. Badiucao said. \u201cThat mentality fits the whole \u2018America First\u2019 ideology, where it\u2019s OK for other people to suffer if your goal is met, and their goal is overthrowing the C.C.P.\u201d Over the past 12 months, the Trump administration has stepped up its actions in Asia. Late last year, the U.S. government barred military leaders from Myanmar from entering the country because of their role in what Mr. Pompeo called \u201cgross violations of human rights\u201d of Rohingya Muslims and other minority groups. Financial sanctions were also placed on individuals in Pakistan and Cambodia, among other countries, where civil liberties are under threat. This summer, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, and 10 others for \u201cundermining Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and restricting the freedom of expression or assembly of the citizens of Hong Kong.\u201d Four more officials were added to the sanctions list this month. In June, Mr. Trump signed legislation that led to sanctions being placed on Chinese officials who have overseen the construction of mass detention camps in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where more than a million people, mostly members of the Uighur Muslim minority, have been imprisoned. \u201cThe Trump administration by far has done more to raise our issue than all other countries combined,\u201d said Salih Hudayar, who was born in Xinjiang and moved to the United States as a child. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical of a Biden administration because I am worried he will allow China to go back to normal, which is a 21st-century genocide of the Uighurs.\u201d During the presidential campaign, Mr. Biden released a statement calling the situation in Xinjiang a \u201cgenocide.\u201d The Trump administration has not used such a designation, and a book by his former national security adviser said that Mr. Trump told Mr. Xi that he should continue building the detention camps in Xinjiang. Foreign policy advisers to Mr. Biden say that it is unfair to presume that he will continue the Obama administration\u2019s moderate stance. It is, they say, a different era. The recent human rights legislation championed by the Trump administration has received broad bipartisan support. And some Asian dissidents acknowledge that the antipathy toward Mr. Biden is driven in part by a deluge of online misinformation that paints the president-elect as a secret socialist or contends, without any proof, that foreign \u201ccommunist money\u201d turned the election against Mr. Trump. Such unsubstantiated claims have been repeated by niche online publications in Vietnamese, Chinese and other languages. \u201cThe crisis of democracy in the world makes people, especially activists, confused and susceptible to the influence of conspiracy theories and information manipulation,\u201d said Nguyen Quang A, a Vietnamese dissident who has been detained multiple times for his criticism of the country\u2019s communist leadership. \u201cVietnam doesn\u2019t have independent media, and people, especially activists, already hate mainstream media.\u201d One of the most influential voices spreading false narratives about Mr. Biden and the election on Twitter is Ai Weiwei, the Chinese contemporary artist who now lives in overseas exile. In an interview, Mr. Ai said that he was not a fan of Mr. Trump. For his art, he has posed at Trump properties with his middle finger raised. But Mr. Ai said that by shutting off debate on his social media feed, he would be no different than an authoritarian government like China\u2019s. \u201cAll over Asia, all over the world, people don\u2019t have the right to speak,\u201d he said. \u201cIn America, left or right, you have personal freedoms. This has to be protected.\u201d Chau Doan contributed reporting from Hanoi, Vietnam; Elaine Yu from Hong Kong; and Saw Nang from Yangon, Myanmar.",

    "article_text": "1918 Germany Has a Warning for America HAMBURG, Germany \u2014 It may well be that Germans have a special inclination to panic at specters from the past, and I admit that this alarmism annoys me at times. Yet watching President Trump\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d campaign since Election Day, I can\u2019t help but see a parallel to one of the most dreadful episodes from Germany\u2019s history. One hundred years ago, amid the implosions of Imperial Germany, powerful conservatives who led the country into war refused to accept that they had lost. Their denial gave birth to arguably the most potent and disastrous political lie of the 20th century \u2014 the Dolchstosslegende, or stab-in-the-back myth. Its core claim was that Imperial Germany never lost World War I. Defeat, its proponents said, was declared but not warranted. It was a conspiracy, a con, a capitulation \u2014 a grave betrayal that forever stained the nation. That the claim was palpably false didn\u2019t matter. Among a sizable number of Germans, it stirred resentment, humiliation and anger. And the one figure who knew best how to exploit their frustration was Adolf Hitler. Don\u2019t get me wrong: This is not about comparing Mr. Trump to Hitler, which would be absurd. But the Dolchstosslegende provides a warning. It\u2019s tempting to dismiss Mr. Trump\u2019s irrational claim that the election was \u201crigged\u201d as a laughable last convulsion of his reign or a cynical bid to heighten the market value for the TV personality he might once again intend to become, especially as he appears to be giving up on his effort to overturn the election result. But that would be a grave error. Instead, the campaign should be seen as what it is: an attempt to elevate \u201cThey stole it\u201d to the level of legend, perhaps seeding for the future social polarization and division on a scale America has never seen. In 1918, Germany was staring at defeat. The entry of the United States into the war the year before, and a sequence of successful counterattacks by British and French forces, left German forces demoralized. Navy sailors went on strike. They had no appetite to be butchered in the hopeless yet supposedly holy mission of Kaiser Wilhelm II and the loyal aristocrats who made up the Supreme Army Command. A starving population joined the strikes and demands for a republic grew. On Nov. 9, 1918, Wilhelm abdicated, and two days later the army leaders signed the armistice. It was too much to bear for many: Military officers, monarchists and right-wingers spread the myth that if it had not been for political sabotage by Social Democrats and Jews back home, the army would never have had to give in. The deceit found willing supporters. \u201cIm Felde unbesiegt\u201d \u2014 \u201cundefeated on the battlefield\u201d \u2014 was the slogan with which returning soldiers were greeted. Newspapers and postcards depicted German soldiers being stabbed in the back by either evil figures carrying the red flag of socialism or grossly caricatured Jews. By the time of the Treaty of Versailles the following year, the myth was already well established. The harsh conditions imposed by the Allies, including painful reparation payments, burnished the sense of betrayal. It was especially incomprehensible that Germany, in just a couple of years, had gone from one of the world\u2019s most respected nations to its biggest loser. The startling aspect about the Dolchstosslegende is this: It did not grow weaker after 1918 but stronger. In the face of humiliation and unable or unwilling to cope with the truth, many Germans embarked on a disastrous self-delusion: The nation had been betrayed, but its honor and greatness could never be lost. And those without a sense of national duty and righteousness \u2014 the left and even the elected government of the new republic \u2014 could never be legitimate custodians of the country. In this way, the myth was not just the sharp wedge that drove the Weimar Republic apart. It was also at the heart of Nazi propaganda, and instrumental in justifying violence against opponents. The key to Hitler\u2019s success was that, by 1933, a considerable part of the German electorate had put the ideas embodied in the myth \u2014 honor, greatness, national pride \u2014 above democracy. The Germans were so worn down by the lost war, unemployment and international humiliation that they fell prey to the promises of a \u201cF\u00fchrer\u201d who cracked down hard on anyone perceived as \u201ctraitors,\u201d leftists and Jews above all. The stab-in-the-back myth was central to it all. When Hitler became chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933, the Nazi newspaper V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter wrote that \u201cirrepressible pride goes through the millions\u201d who fought so long to \u201cundo the shame of 9 November 1918.\u201d Germany\u2019s first democracy fell. Without a basic consensus built on a shared reality, society split into groups of ardent, uncompromising partisans. And in an atmosphere of mistrust and paranoia, the notion that dissenters were threats to the nation steadily took hold. Alarmingly, that seems to be exactly what is happening in the United States today. According to the Pew Research Center, 89 percent of Trump supporters believe that a Joe Biden presidency would do \u201clasting harm to the U.S.,\u201d while 90 percent of Biden supporters think the reverse. And while the question of which news media to trust has long split America, now even the largely unmoderated Twitter is regarded as partisan. Since the election, millions of Trump supporters have installed the alternative social media app Parler. Filter bubbles are turning into filter networks. In such a landscape of social fragmentation, Mr. Trump\u2019s baseless accusations about electoral fraud could do serious harm. A staggering 88 percent of Trump voters believe that the election result is illegitimate, according to a YouGov poll. A myth of betrayal and injustice is well underway. It took another war and decades of reappraisal for the Dolchstosslegende to be exposed as a disastrous, fatal fallacy. If it has any worth today, it is in the lessons it can teach other nations.

    "article_text": "Supreme Court Skeptical of Trump\u2019s Plan to Not Count Unauthorized Immigrants in Redistricting WASHINGTON \u2014 A skeptical Supreme Court on Monday reacted with frustration and some confusion to President Trump\u2019s plan to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the calculations used to allocate seats in the House. While there was some discussion about whether the plan was lawful, the more immediate questions for the justices were where the administration stood in its efforts to identify and count the unauthorized immigrants and what role the court should play if substantial numbers were not identified. Removing undocumented immigrants from the census would most likely have the effect of shifting congressional seats and federal money to states that are older, whiter and typically more Republican. But if the Census Bureau cannot provide Mr. Trump with specific information about a large enough number of unauthorized immigrants in the coming weeks, he will not be able to exclude enough of them from the reapportionment to change the way House seats are allocated. That would leave the justices without a concrete dispute to decide. \u201cThe situation is fairly fluid,\u201d Jeffrey B. Wall, the acting United States solicitor general, told the justices, conceding that the Census Bureau may not be able to supply Mr. Trump with much data on unauthorized immigrants. \u201cThere is a real prospect that the numbers will not affect the apportionment,\u201d he said. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said that put the court in an odd position. \u201cI find the posture of this case quite frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be that this is much ado about very little.\u201d The Commerce Department is required to supply census information to the president by the end of the year, but it may not be able to meet that deadline. Mr. Wall indicated that the Census Bureau had good data on the tens of thousands of people held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the number is almost certainly too small to change apportionment. He was less certain that the bureau could match records concerning people subject to orders of removal, young immigrants known as Dreamers or other categories of unauthorized immigrants. If there is data to allow Mr. Trump to exclude enough immigrants to change the allocation of House seats, the case would become quite important. Indeed, if the court rules for the administration on the core question in the case, it would upend a longtime consensus that the government must count all residents of the United States, whatever their immigration status, with the potential to shift political power and federal money from Democratic states to Republican ones. But there was only limited discussion of that question on Monday, though several justices, including some conservatives, expressed skepticism about the administration\u2019s arguments. \u201cA lot of the historical evidence and longstanding practice really cuts against your position,\u201d Justice Amy Coney Barrett told Mr. Wall. He responded that the novelty of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach did not make it unlawful. \u201cI\u2019ll certainly grant,\u201d Mr. Wall said, \u201cthat no president has made this judgment before.\u201d Most of the argument focused on the practical complications in the case.  Mr. Wall said the process was cumbersome and difficult. \u201cWe\u2019re literally trying to individually identify people who are present in the United States in violation of federal law,\u201d he said. Mr. Wall suggested that the plaintiffs could file a new lawsuit after Mr. Trump submits a statement to Congress setting out the number of representatives to which each state is entitled if House seats shift because of the exclusion of unauthorized immigrants. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was skeptical. \u201cIsn\u2019t that going to be like having to unscramble the eggs?\u201d he asked. Other justices wondered whether the court should simply defer a decision in the current case, which it had put on an exceptionally fast track, until more information becomes available in the coming weeks. The Constitution requires congressional districts to be apportioned \u201ccounting the whole number of persons in each state,\u201d using information from the census. In July, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum taking a new approach. \u201cFor the purpose of the reapportionment of representatives following the 2020 census,\u201d the memo said, \u201cit is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status.\u201d \u201cCurrent estimates suggest that one state is home to more than 2.2 million illegal aliens, constituting more than 6 percent of the state\u2019s entire population,\u201d the memo said, apparently referring to California. \u201cIncluding these illegal aliens in the population of the state for the purpose of apportionment could result in the allocation of two or three more congressional seats than would otherwise be allocated.\u201d In the memo, Mr. Trump ordered Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, to provide him with two sets of numbers, one including unauthorized immigrants and the other not. But it became unclear how Mr. Ross would derive the second set of numbers after the Supreme Court last year rejected his efforts to add a question on citizenship to the census. The case before the court, Trump v. New York, No. 20-366, was brought by two sets of plaintiffs, one a group of state and local governments and the United States Conference of Mayors, and the second a coalition of advocacy groups and other nongovernmental organizations. A three-judge panel of the Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that the new policy violated federal law. Two other courts have issued similar rulings, while one said the dispute was not ripe for consideration. In an unsigned opinion in the case from Manhattan, the panel said the question before it was \u201cnot particularly close or complicated.\u201d \u201cThe secretary is required to report a single set of figures to the president \u2014 namely, \u2018the tabulation of total population by states\u2019 under the \u2018decennial census\u2019 \u2014 and the president is then required to use those same figures to determine apportionment using the method of equal proportions,\u201d the panel wrote, quoting the relevant statutes. Chief Justice Roberts questioned the first part of the analysis. \u201cIt seems to me that you\u2019re asking really for a gag order on the secretary of commerce concerning his communications to the president,\u201d he told Barbara D. Underwood, New York\u2019s solicitor general. Ms. Underwood said the secretary was free to provide information about unauthorized immigrants in other ways. \u201cIt might be usable for many other things,\u201d she said, \u201cbut not as part of the apportionment.\u201d Mr. Wall told the justices that it was lawful to exclude unauthorized immigrants. \u201cIt\u2019s the sovereign\u2019s prerogative to define the political community,\u201d he said. Ms. Underwood responded that the administration was asking the court to endorse a stunning departure from the nation\u2019s traditions. \u201cThe Constitution and laws provide that House seats should be allocated on the basis of total population,\u201d she said. \u201cThe framers wanted a system that could not easily be manipulated. So they decided to count just the persons living in each state. The policy here would for the first time in this nation\u2019s history reject that choice.\u201d Dale Ho, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said Mr. Trump\u2019s authority was limited. \u201cWhile the president may have some discretion in borderline cases,\u201d Mr. Ho said, \u201che does not have authority to erase millions of state residents from the apportionment based solely on unlawful immigration status.\u201d The argument was conducted by telephone, with the justices asking questions one at a time, in order of seniority, subject to strict time limits enforced by the chief justice. At one point, Justice Alito seemed to chafe at that restriction, launching into a six-part question after the chief justice had indicated that his time was up. He managed to ask three of his six questions before Chief Justice Roberts cut him off.",

    "article_text": "The King of Trump TV Thinks You\u2019re Dumb Enough to Buy It In 2004, Hillary Clinton was in the Senate and Christopher Ruddy had some making up to do. He was, back then, best known as \u201cthe Inspector Clouseau\u201d of the Vince Foster case \u2014\u00a0a New York Post reporter who had popularized the baseless theory that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s friend, who committed suicide in 1993, had been murdered. But it now seemed possible that Mrs. Clinton might run for president, and Mr. Ruddy laid it on pretty thick. Mrs. Clinton was doing \u201ca remarkably and surprising good job for NY as Senator,\u201d he wrote to a mutual friend, former Mayor Ed Koch of New York. \u201cI might not like Hillary\u2019s liberalism, but I don\u2019t dislike her on a personal level \u2014 as I do Rudy. Rudy Giuliani is a bad person.\u201d I asked an amused former Clinton aide to dredge this correspondence out of an old box because Mr. Ruddy, a Long Island-born 55-year-old, has emerged as the most audacious media entrepreneur of the Trump election fantasy. The chief executive of Newsmax and part of President Trump\u2019s South Florida social circle, Mr. Ruddy has capitalized on the anger of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters at Fox News for delivering the unwelcome news, first in Arizona and then nationally, that Mr. Trump had lost his re-election campaign. On Newsmax, however, the fight is still on, the imaginary election-altering Kraken is yet to be released, Mr. Trump is striving valiantly for four more years and the ratings are incredible. Newsmax\u2019s prime-time ratings, which averaged 58,000 before Election Day, soared to 1.1 million afterward for its top shows, with one host, Greg Kelly, cheerleading on Twitter and on the air for \u201cthe QUEST TO COUNT all the LEGAL VOTES.\u201d The ratings even drew a congratulatory call from Mr. Trump himself, my colleagues Michael Grynbaum and John Koblin reported last week. But Mr. Ruddy, as those Clinton messages show, is not the sort of true-believing ideologue his viewers may imagine in the foxhole alongside them. He is, rather, perhaps the purest embodiment of another classic television type, the revenue-minded cynic for whom the substance of programming is just a path to money and power. All successful TV programmers have some mercenary in them, of course, but even by those standards, Mr. Ruddy is extreme. He has turned Newsmax into a pure vehicle for Trumpism, attacking Fox News from the right for including occasional dissenting voices. And when Trumpism turned this month from an electoral strategy into a hallucinatory attempt to overturn the election, Mr. Ruddy saw opportunity: Newsmax, available on cable in most American households and streaming online, became the home of alternate reality. \u201cIn this day and age, people want something that tends to affirm their views and opinions,\u201d Mr. Ruddy told me in an interview. He wasn\u2019t hard to reach. Like many people who get generally, even inexplicably, friendly media coverage, the genial Mr. Ruddy is always willing to talk to the press. He is, in fact, a rare and valuable commodity: someone with real access to Mr. Trump who will tell the truth on the record. His insights \u2014 62 quotes in The New York Times in the last four years, 61 in The Washington Post and 51 appearances on CNN \u2014 deliver what journalists crave: up-close insights about the president. He has even invited reporters to tag along to Mar-a-Lago as his guest at the president\u2019s private club, which has been a minor irritant for President Trump\u2019s staff, two former Trump aides told me. Not that he\u2019s made any secret of his strategy. The fake crisis of the U.S. electoral system is \u201cgreat for news,\u201d he told The New Yorker\u2019s Isaac Chotiner last week. Mr. Ruddy is hardly alone in the sudden scramble to convert Mr. Trump\u2019s political profile into cash. \u201cThere are a lot of well-capitalized people circling,\u201d said Michael Clemente, a former executive at ABC News and Fox News and former chief executive of Newsmax, who has been part of conversations as a potential leader of a new venture. He describes the proposition as a question of math, and the dominance of liberal-leaning cable channels: \u201cFifty percent of the country has 90 percent of the news media speaking to them.\u201d The noisiest effort is led by Hicks Equity Partners, the family business of a Republican National Committee co-chairman and friend of Donald Trump Jr., Thomas Hicks Jr. The Hicks group has sought to lead buyouts of both Newsmax and its smaller and stranger rival, the One America News Network. The group is also pursuing a third strategy, according to a confidential investment proposal I obtained, which would focus on culture rather than news: building \u201ca family-friendly programming destination of broad appeal based on traditional values\u201d by buying and merging a small \u201cequestrian sports and lifestyle\u201d channel and a larger one, which a person briefed on the talks identified as the small, independent Ride-TV and Great American Country, which is owned by the cable behemoth Discovery. (A spokesman for Hicks Equity Partners didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry about a potential deal.) Other possibilities for the president to cash in on his stature include creating a new Trump TV network from scratch, either as a television broadcast channel, a package of online video or even a way to direct cash into the Trump family political operation. Mr. Ruddy has a head start. His main commercial advantage is the network\u2019s distribution, which the company says puts it in 70 million of the roughly 90 million American homes that have cable, thanks to deals with the largest distributors, Comcast and AT&T. It\u2019s a laborious, and expensive, process to get onto the cable package \u2014\u00a0even if you are, as Newsmax currently is, way up the dial. The programming is also available through a livestream on its app and on a range of newer \u201cover-the-top\u201d TV platforms like Roku. (OAN claims to be available in about half as many cable homes.) The process of establishing a cable network is also deeply political, as things often are in monopolistic industries: Newsmax was dropped from AT&T\u2019s DirectTV in 2016, and restored the next year after Senator Charles E. Grassley called the move \u201cunfair\u201d during hearings about AT&T\u2019s attempt to acquire Time Warner. You could imagine executives at Comcast and AT&T taking their time to make a deal with Trump TV. But Mr. Ruddy also has a problem. His TV business, a speculative bet that could be worth billions if it can cut deeply into Fox\u2019s audience, currently loses money. The company invested $70 million from 2014 to 2017, according to a confidential overview produced for potential investors in 2018 that one of them shared with me. And Mr. Ruddy told me Newsmax is still investing. Those costs are partly because new channels often pay cable companies to get on TV. Mr. Ruddy declined to describe his specific arrangements with the cable providers, but said, \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for companies to do that when they start out.\u201d And it\u2019s partly because big advertisers have fled right-wing talk shows, leaving even the widely viewed prime-time shows on Fox News with less lucrative \u201cdirect response\u201d ads for pillows and medical devices. Newsmax has inverted the usual media business dynamic. The company is losing money on television, and making it on the internet, though Mr. Ruddy told me he expects that \u201crevenues on cable and OTT television will be more robust and consistent than the online business for the next 10 years.\u201d Newsmax has built a solid, and unusual, business by catering to the 50-and-older demographic it described in the document shared with investors as \u201cBoomers and Beyond.\u201d The website\u2019s voice, its big and lucrative email lists, and its products, from books to magazines to vitamin supplements, have the tone of conservative direct mail. And it\u2019s working: The company projected its 2018 revenues at more than $59 million, divided among advertising, subscriptions and e-commerce. (One sponsor on the app last week was selling health advice, asking \u201cIs the \u2018Pandemic\u2019 a Lie?\u201d) Newsmax has been raising money to finance its TV ambitions. Private equity from \u201ca couple of investors,\u201d Mr. Ruddy said, has paid to upgrade studios and hire figures like Mr. Kelly and the former White House press secretary Sean Spicer as the hosts of shows that replaced hours of World War II documentaries, and carry conservative radio talkers including Howie Carr from Boston. The investors, he said, are domestic, despite a Politico report (picked up on Breitbart) indicating he was in talks to raise money from Qatar. Mr. Ruddy said he sent proposals to many sovereign wealth funds, among others, but has not taken foreign investment. He blames his former rival, Stephen Bannon, for pushing the Qatar story, but such grudges are fleeting in the often-shifting alliances of the new right: Mr. Bannon\u2019s podcast, \u201cWar Room,\u201d is now also broadcast on Newsmax late at night on weekdays. Newsmax now needs to raise more money, or sell fast, if it\u2019s going to keep upgrading its talent and production quality to press its advantage with Fox News \u2014 which has begun nervously trying to block guests from appearing on the network. When I pressed Mr. Ruddy on why he was stringing along his audience with a story he can\u2019t, really, himself believe \u2014 that Mr. Trump won the election \u2014 he didn\u2019t really defend it. Instead, he countered that he wasn\u2019t the only one. \u201cFor two years, the liberal media pushed this Russian hoax theory, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any substantiation at the end of the day and it was a pretty compelling, gripping story \u2014\u00a0controversial personalities, things happened, sparks were flying,\u201d he said. Newsmax continues to tell a gripping story. On Friday night, Mr. Kelly referred to Joe Biden\u2019s \u201calleged victory,\u201d hosted a long interview with Rudy Giuliani and later turned to an analyst who gave Mr. Trump a \u201c35 to 40 percent chance that he wins this.\u201d The 8 p.m. host, Grant Stinchfield, announced that \u201cthe momentum seems to be shifting back to the president\u2019s favor,\u201d and interviewed a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Jenna Ellis, and a Pennsylvania state senator trying to take back the state\u2019s election certification. Mr. Ruddy\u2019s cynicism brings me back to the most trenchant attack from conservative media on the mainstream media: that journalists think conservatives are stupid. Tucker Carlson regularly tells his audience that the college-educated snobs in New York who preside over the major outlets view conservatives as unsophisticated rubes, misled by misinformation, not as people who actually believe in the ideas pushed by Mr. Trump, like immigration should be sharply curtailed. Those attacks on the media are often false, but the coastal media sometimes does fail to understand people who aren\u2019t like them, left and right, and sometimes they patronize their audiences. But nobody I\u2019ve ever covered treats an audience with the blithe disdain of Mr. Ruddy. He has them watching a great story \u2014\u00a0a thriller, a whodunit \u2014\u00a0about a stolen election. He thinks they\u2019re stupid enough to fall for it, dumb enough to keep watching even after the fantasy inevitably dissolves, buying the supplements and the books and, crucially, tuning in to channel 1115 in large enough numbers that, eventually, the cable companies will pay him. Perhaps he actually thinks his viewers are that dumb. Or maybe he just needs them to stick around long enough for him to find someone just as cynical, but with more cash on hand, to buy him out.",
