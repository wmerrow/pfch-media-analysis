    "article_text": "The Decency Agenda Joe Biden won the presidency because, at a moment when so many Americans were exhausted by the chaos and nastiness of the Trump era, he promised stability, decency and healing. At the heart of his candidacy was the vow to be \u201ca president for all Americans\u201d as he labored \u201cto restore the soul of the nation.\u201d \u201cThe presidency itself is not a partisan institution,\u201d Mr. Biden stressed the day after the election. \u201cIt\u2019s the one office in this nation that represents everyone, and it demands a duty of care for all Americans. That is precisely what I will do.\u201d This is a soothing bit of uplift. But in a nation so starkly polarized, what does it even mean? While a record 81 million people voted for Mr. Biden, some 74 million voted to give President Trump four more years in office. Forget shared values: Americans cannot agree on a shared reality. Too many of us live in echo chambers, consuming information tailored to support our existing biases. Partisan warfare impels people to deny the legitimacy, even the humanity, of those with different viewpoints. What hope does any president have of bridging this gulf? Mr. Biden might consider a three-pronged approach. Call it the Decency Agenda. The first element is turning down the heat of the culture wars as they intersect with politics. Too often, proxy fights create more outrage than progress. The second part involves finding shared ground on policy that can push the country forward, even as it works to address its entrenched inequities and divisions. Could it at last be time for a serious \u201cinfrastructure week\u201d? The third element involves accountability. Not a truth commission mounted out of spite, or justice sought in the spirit of vengeance. But some way to get answers about what happened during the Trump administration, coupled with an attempt to restore some guardrails that proved insufficient to restrain Mr. Trump\u2019s worst impulses. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll have more to say about parts two and three of such an agenda. It\u2019s too simplistic to say that the way to tamp down America\u2019s raging culture wars is for the incoming president to do the precise opposite of the departing one. But, in key respects, that prescription isn\u2019t far-off. This is not so much about policy, although putting together an agenda with broad appeal and bipartisan support will be a big part of Mr. Biden\u2019s challenge. This is about something more elemental \u2014 the president-elect\u2019s conception of leadership. Mr. Trump has approached the presidency, as he does everything, as a zero-sum proposition: To win, someone else must lose. Grounded in the politics of division, Trumpism is about attitude. The more antagonistic, the better. The president\u2019s re-election campaign wanted to \u201cmake liberals cry again.\u201d This kind of leadership poisons the body politic, a little more each day. Presidents are role models. Their words and comportment influence their supporters and, more generally, set the tone for the national discourse. Mr. Trump has not merely normalized cruelty and boorishness; he has given it the imprimatur of the Oval Office. One of Mr. Biden\u2019s most basic jobs will be to model a different leadership \u2014 to reclaim what it means to be presidential in a way that restores dignity and humanity to the office. Some of what this requires is straightforward: Don\u2019t demean political opponents or fellow world leaders. Don\u2019t insult members of your own administration. Don\u2019t accuse people who merely disagree with you of treason. Don\u2019t have a Twitter tantrum every time your feelings get bruised. Or, maybe, stay off Twitter altogether. More specifically, Mr. Biden will need to restore and reinforce some guardrails and norms that Mr. Trump tore down, in the recognition that not even presidents are above the law. He has already made his tax returns public, a welcome step back toward accountability. Going forward, he will need to make clear that key institutions \u2014 the Department of Justice, the intelligence community and the military, for starters \u2014 will be free from partisan meddling. His administration\u2019s inspectors general must be treated as guardians, not turncoats, and they may need to be granted additional protections. He will need to acknowledge that oversight of the executive branch is a legitimate function of Congress, not something to be dismissed out of hand. Speaking to the concerns of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, without condemnation or condescension, will be crucial to Mr. Biden\u2019s unification efforts. It helps that the new president has an unpolished, regular-guy appeal and a knack for connecting on a personal level that keeps him from seeming like a snooty elitist. His Catholic faith is important to him, which will resonate in many enclaves. In pursuing his governing agenda, disagreements will arise over deeply held beliefs, and the arguments are bound to get heated. But, unlike his predecessor, Mr. Biden knows the difference between opponents and enemies. Mr. Trump has stoked cultural conflict \u2014 by, for instance, declaring war on N.F.L. players who kneel during the national anthem. Mr. Biden presumably will find better uses of his time and energy. Not every culture-war skirmish merits presidential involvement, and many would be better managed without it. QAnon may be a disturbing sign of the times, but it does not yet rise to the level of a presidential talking point. Neither do the \u201cthin blue line\u201d flags that are a sign of police solidarity and, depending on whom you ask, white supremacy. With the coronavirus holding center stage, even core culture-war issues \u2014 abortion, L.G.B.T.Q. rights, religious freedom, assault weapons \u2014 may wind up relegated to the political background. There will be movement on all of these issues outside of Mr. Biden\u2019s control, either in Congress or the courts. But he need not celebrate or mourn each of these developments as an existential victory or defeat. Not because they aren\u2019t important, but precisely because they incite such passion and fury. All of these questions will be contested long after Mr. Biden\u2019s term in office is over. These long-simmering challenges will still be there, waiting, when the acute trauma of the pandemic has passed and the nation begins its recovery. Mr. Biden has the temperament and the tools to moderate rather than maximize conflict. When the death of George Floyd this spring sparked nationwide protests over racial injustice and police brutality, forcing those issues to the forefront of the presidential race, Mr. Trump sought to inflame tensions. Who can forget his Twitter invocation of the civil rights-era phrase, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d? Mr. Biden took a different approach. He acknowledged America\u2019s entrenched racism and stressed his support for police reform, even as he rightfully rejected the edgier calls to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d He reached out to the victims of and the families impacted by police violence, offering comfort and understanding, and he sympathized with the frustration and anger of the protesters. But he also condemned the pockets of violent rioting that accompanied some protests. His goal was not to downplay the problem but to lower the temperature on a crisis that threatened to consume the nation. Nowhere has the bleed of culture wars into politics been deadlier than in what should have been a wholly apolitical matter: the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Historians will puzzle over the idea that mask-wearing in service of protecting all citizens was considered by many to be a mark of oppression. Imagine if supporters of free trade or the Green New Deal decided to shun wearing seatbelts, as a political statement. The pandemic is a public health emergency requiring precautions and sacrifices. Yet Americans are also weary of those sacrifices and depressed and frustrated by having their lives turned upside down. As president, Mr. Biden can express empathy with such exhaustion, while standing firm on the necessity of ongoing safety measures. He can continue to model good behavior, like mask-wearing and social distancing. He can decline to host potential super-spreader events in the Rose Garden. Other members of his administration can be directed to follow suit. A national mask mandate might not be feasible at this point, but calling on government workers to observe basic safety precautions is well within the president\u2019s authority. If Americans see their leaders working to keep the public safe, they may be more willing to do their part. If, as seems likely, the new president inherits a divided government, some of the more ambitious items on many of his supporters\u2019 wish lists will have to be set aside for now. As a candidate, Mr. Biden won plaudits for his listening skills and for his outreach to former rivals. Once in office, he\u2019ll need to keep the lines of communication wide open and ensure that his restive base does not feel taken for granted. Pretty much every move Mr. Biden makes will disappoint some constituency. Such is the nature of the presidency. His persistent challenge will be to deal with all parties respectfully, bringing people into the conversation and making them feel heard. Even when his outreach efforts fail, they will send a message about how he views his job. \u201cLet\u2019s give each other a chance,\u201d Mr. Biden pleaded in his Nov. 7 victory speech. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put away the harsh rhetoric. Lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not enemies. They are Americans.\u201d America\u2019s divisions predate Mr. Trump, and they will outlast Mr. Biden. But there is progress to be made. And there is value in the very act of trying.

    "article_text": "Biden Picks Xavier Becerra to Lead Health and Human Services WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has selected Xavier Becerra, the Democratic attorney general of California, as his nominee for secretary of health and human services, tapping a former congressman who would be the first Latino to run the department as it battles the surging coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Becerra became Mr. Biden\u2019s clear choice only over the past few days, according to people familiar with the transition\u2019s deliberations, and was a surprise. Mr. Becerra has carved out a profile on the issues of criminal justice and immigration, and he was long thought to be a candidate for attorney general. But as attorney general in California, he has been at the forefront of legal efforts on health care, leading 20 states and the District of Columbia in a campaign to protect the Affordable Care Act from being dismantled by his Republican counterparts. He has also been vocal in the Democratic Party about fighting for women\u2019s health. If confirmed, Mr. Becerra will immediately face a daunting task in leading the department at a critical moment during a pandemic that has killed more than 281,000 people in the United States \u2014 and one that has taken a particularly devastating toll on people of color. \u201cThe A.C.A. has been life-changing and now through this pandemic, we can all see the value in having greater access to quality health care at affordable prices,\u201d Mr. Becerra said in June, when he filed a brief with the Supreme Court in defense of the health care law. \u201cNow is not the time to rip away our best tool to address very real and very deadly health disparities in our communities.\u201d A spokesman for Mr. Biden\u2019s transition team declined to comment. The president-elect plans to formally announce Mr. Becerra as his choice to lead the health department early this week, along with several other top health care advisers, according to people familiar with the rollout. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, will be selected to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a person familiar with Mr. Biden\u2019s deliberations. Dr. Walensky, whose selection was reported earlier by Politico, will replace Dr. Robert R. Redfield as the leader of the scientific agency at the forefront of the nation\u2019s pandemic response. Dr. Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general under President Barack Obama, will reprise that role for Mr. Biden. A telegenic confidant of the president-elect, Mr. Murthy will become one of Mr. Biden\u2019s closest advisers on medical issues and will lead much of the public outreach on the pandemic. Jeffrey D. Zients, an entrepreneur and management consultant who served as the head of Mr. Obama\u2019s National Economic Council and fixed the bungled rollout of the health law\u2019s online insurance marketplace, will become a coronavirus czar in the White House, leading efforts to coordinate the fight against the coronavirus pandemic among the government\u2019s sprawling agencies. Some medical experts, who have been pushing the Biden team to name people with medical or public health expertise to serve in health leadership positions, were caught off guard \u2014 and unhappily so \u2014 by the news of Mr. Becerra\u2019s selection. In a letter sent last week to Mr. Biden, five leading medical groups \u2014 the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Physicians among them \u2014 called on the president-elect to appoint \u201cqualified physicians to serve in key positions critical to advancing the health of our nation.\u201d One person familiar with that effort said people involved were \u201castounded\u201d by the selection of Mr. Becerra, and suggested that Mr. Biden elevate Dr. Murthy to a cabinet-level position. But in an interview on Sunday night, Dr. Ada D. Stewart, the president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, one of the groups that sent the letter, described Mr. Becerra as \u201ca good choice\u201d and \u201can experienced legislator and executive\u201d \u2014 even as she conceded that her group would \u201cprefer, of course, to have a physician in this position.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen his commitment to health and equity, and those things can\u2019t be overlooked,\u201d she said. Mr. Becerra\u2019s experience in Washington may also help Mr. Biden secure legislative changes to bolster the Affordable Care Act, a central promise that the president-elect made during the 2020 campaign. Mr. Becerra, 62, served 12 terms in Congress, representing Los Angeles, before becoming the attorney general of his home state in 2017. He is the first Latino to hold that office, and while in Congress he was the first Latino to serve as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, where he worked on health care as a senior member of the health subcommittee. He also led the House Democratic Caucus, which gave him a powerful leadership post. An outspoken advocate of improved health care access, Mr. Becerra said in 2017 that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d support Medicare for all, a proposal for government-run health care that Mr. Biden has explicitly rejected. A source familiar with the selection said Mr. Becerra would support the president-elect\u2019s call for strengthening and preserving the A.C.A. and would not be pushing Medicare for all while in office. As California\u2019s top law enforcement official, Mr. Becerra helped lead legal fights across the nation for access to health care, focusing in particular on dismantling barriers for women struggling to get medical services. In April, Mr. Becerra led a coalition of 22 state attorneys general in challenging a Mississippi law that prohibited doctors from providing abortion services past 15 weeks. In a statement at the time, Mr. Becerra called the ban \u201cunjust, unlawful, and unfair.\u201d \u201cLaws like Mississippi\u2019s are a systematic attempt to undo a woman\u2019s constitutional rights under Roe v. Wade,\u201d he said. \u201cI will continue to stand up for safe access to reproductive care and defend these rights for all women.\u201d Mr. Becerra\u2019s office boasted frequently of the many lawsuits he had filed against the Trump administration, including suits challenging the president\u2019s immigration and environmental policies. His activism in fighting the Trump agenda in court earned him praise from leading progressives in the Democratic Party. In September, Mr. Becerra said the tally of his anti-Trump lawsuits had grown to 100. But Mr. Becerra also partnered with Republican counterparts at times, joining a bipartisan group of attorneys general in August to urge the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies to increase access to remdesivir, a drug that has shown promise in treating Covid-19. He also worked with Republicans to prevent student vaping. Born in Sacramento, Mr. Becerra grew up in a working-class family; his mother emigrated from Mexico, and he was the first in his family to graduate from college. He attended Stanford as an undergraduate and received his law degree there in 1984. Mr. Biden was impressed by Mr. Becerra\u2019s personal story, according to a person familiar with his thinking. In particular, the president-elect liked the fact that Mr. Becerra served clients with mental health needs shortly after graduating from law school, the person said. While in Congress, Mr. Becerra was a fierce advocate of the Latino community and became deeply involved in efforts to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system. He also promoted plans to build a national museum devoted to exploring the culture and history of American Latinos. The House voted this year to create such a museum. Representative Filemon Vela, Democrat of Texas, praised Mr. Biden\u2019s choice of Mr. Becerra, calling it \u201chistoric\u201d and saying the California attorney general was the right person to lead the sprawling agency during the worst public health crisis in 100 years. \u201cBecerra will lead an agency that will play a crucial role in overseeing a massive immunization effort and help manage a bolstered federal response to tackle the worsening Covid-19 crisis,\u201d Mr. Vela said. \u201cHe will also help shape the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to build on the Affordable Care Act.\u201d In the late 1990s, Mr. Becerra traveled to Cuba and visited with its leader, Fidel Castro, which infuriated Republican members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. They resigned, saying they were \u201cpersonally insulted\u201d by the visit. Mr. Biden\u2019s selection of Mr. Becerra to replace the current secretary, Alex M. Azar II, comes as the president-elect is under increasing pressure from the Latino community and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to diversify his cabinet. Mr. Becerra is the second Latino Mr. Biden has chosen for his cabinet after the selection last month of Alejandro N. Mayorkas, a Cuban immigrant, as secretary of homeland security. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico had been thought to be in line for the health secretary\u2019s job, but she apparently fell out of the running. Instead, news leaked last week that Ms. Lujan Grisham had been offered, and turned down, the position of interior secretary. The leak prompted Senator-elect Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico to use a private meeting with top Biden advisers to rebuke the incoming White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, and other senior Biden officials for their treatment of Ms. Lujan Grisham, according to a Democrat familiar with the discussion. If approved, Mr. Becerra\u2019s nomination would create yet another statewide office in California to be filled by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was already considering candidates, including Mr. Becerra, for the Senate seat being vacated by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Mr. Becerra has been California\u2019s attorney general since 2017, when Ms. Harris was elected to the Senate and Gov. Jerry Brown appointed him to fill her seat. His term would expire in 2022.

    "article_text": "After Centuries of Obscurity, Wilmington Is Having a Moment WILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 The hometown of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has long wrestled with its image problem. Namely, it does not have one. If people could find Wilmington on a map \u2014 and many couldn\u2019t \u2014 they thought of it as a convenient pit stop along the Northeast Corridor, which was dominated by far larger, more important, more colorful places. It is a city lacking a well-known culinary dish, historical event, professional sports team or even a particular catchphrase.  And yet, against dubious odds not unlike those that Mr. Biden overcame in reaching the presidency after three tries, Wilmington appears determined to ride the Biden wave to long-elusive glory. \u201cUsually, nobody pays attention to us, and now we are on the news every night!\u201d exclaimed Karen Kegelman of the Delaware Historical Society, whose first memorable encounter with Mr. Biden dates back to when he spoke at her high school graduation. She is 53. The president-elect has transformed the city into a federal-government-in-waiting. He delivers speeches and television interviews from the Queen, a restored theater downtown. His motorcade, 20 vehicles long, regularly brings traffic to a screeching halt, and gawking drivers appear delighted. Cabinet nominees swan through the opulent lobby of the Hotel Du Pont. Suddenly, all of Wilmington is bathing in the dizzying warmth of an unexpected spotlight. \u201cIt creates a little mystique about the city,\u201d Mayor Michael S. Purzycki said. \u201cIt creates great curiosity about the city \u2014 people coming by all the time wanting to know what is going on, tell me about your city.\u201d Mr. Purzycki harbors no illusions regarding the colorless reputation of his town: \u201cWilmington has always been on I-95 between Washington, Philly and New York, you know.\u201d He compared its famously dull, corporate vibe to the unvarying \u201cMad Men\u201d uniform worn by the legions of lawyers and chemical engineers who once populated its downtown: \u201ca white shirt, a sincere tie and 12-pound wingtips.\u201d \u201cIt was not a creative culture,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was pretty predictable, stay within the guard rails.\u201d The main mystery about the place seems to be identifying something, anything, that distinctly says \u201cWilmington.\u201d Ask residents to name a unique feature and the universal response is a long pause. \u201cIt\u2019s intimate,\u201d some will eventually say. That\u2019s a euphemism for small. The population hit a high mark of almost 90,000 circa 1940 and is now at around 72,000. Others will point you to the Court of Chancery. It is not quite the Statue of Liberty or the Grand Canyon, but it is a singular institution in the United States. Corporate titans use the specialized court to wage legal Armageddon to control stock shares, but companies must be registered in Delaware to present a case. Nearly 1.5 million are, including household names like Coca-Cola and Geico. When Walt Disney Co. shareholders balked at the $140 million severance package paid mostly in stock options to Michael Ovitz in 1996 after he was dismissed as president of the company, for example, they tried to claw them back in chancery court and lost. The court has been around since 1792, but try finding it. There is not even a sign for it outside the 12-story, steel and glass tower on North King Street that it shares with other courts. The low profile belies the riches it generates. Last year, taxes and fees for corporate registrations amounted to $1.45 billion, roughly 30 percent of the state\u2019s operating budget, said Jonathan Starkey, spokesman for Gov. John Carney. There is a dark side, too. Secrecy laws allow foreign kleptocrats and other nefarious types to stash ill-gotten gains anonymously, though reform efforts are underway. Weighty matters, but not the stuff of tourist stampedes. People thinking of tax or financial havens tend to picture Monaco or Panama, while Wilmington lacks either super yachts or a signature hat. Still, residents point to places like the booming Riverfront neighborhood, reclaimed from industrial wasteland, as well as new restaurants and galleries downtown to indicate that Wilmington is trying to change. \u201cI wanted to bring some light and energy to Wilmington,\u201d said Nataki Oliver, who opened a small gallery called The Sold Firm to feature Black artists and to offer painting classes for children. Aside from corporations, two of the three \u201cCs\u201d that constitute the city\u2019s holy trinity \u2014 credit cards and chemicals \u2014 have faded somewhat. Credit card companies rushed in, starting in the 1980s, after Delaware removed all caps on interest rates, as long as the firms based their operations locally. The volume of credit card bills means they have their own ZIP code, but mergers have diminished the number of institutions. The third C is chemicals. E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, usually known as DuPont, began in 1802 by manufacturing gunpowder. DuPont and its fabulously wealthy owners dominated Wilmington for the next 200 years, creating products like nylon, Teflon and Kevlar. Its 2017 merger with Dow Chemical Company largely ended that reign, even if the family and the company left traces everywhere. There is a duPont hospital, a du Pont high school, a Dupont street and a DuPont country club. The main area attractions include three former du Pont estates. (There are nearly as many spellings as there are du Pont institutions.)  Mr. Biden announced that he would appoint a climate change \u201cczar\u201d in a speech delivered at the Delaware Museum of Natural History. It, too, was founded by a du Pont heir, an expert ornithologist who collected 66,000 birds and two million seashells. The founder does not get mentioned so much because in 1996 he shot dead an Olympic wrestling champion at a training camp that he had established on his estate. When the convicted murderer died in prison in 2010, he left the bulk of his estimated $200 million fortune to a Bulgarian wrestler. There are other intriguing bits of Wilmington lore. Swedes founded the city in 1683, and they managed to invent the log cabin before the Dutch ran them off after 17 years. Bob Marley worked in a car plant and as a janitor in the Hotel Du Pont in the early 1970s. Something grander or more famous always seems to overshadow hallmark Wilmington moments, however. Rodney Square, the heart of downtown Wilmington, was named after a founding father who rode overnight to Philadelphia to cast a deciding vote for the Declaration of Independence. Yet the midnight ride of that founding father, Caesar Rodney, never got the same press as Paul Revere\u2019s journey. (Wilmington also cannot decide when it happened. The plinth for the statue of the galloping Mr. Rodney bears two different dates: July 1-2, 1776, and July 3-4, 1776.) Mr. Rodney also owned slaves, and during the protests that erupted last summer after the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, city officials whisked the statue off to New Jersey for safekeeping. There has long been a thorny relationship between Wilmington\u2019s mostly Black, impoverished center and its largely white, wealthy suburbs. Riots that erupted after the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. devastated the downtown, and the nervous governor at the time set a nationwide record by deploying National Guard troops for nine months. The scattered pieces of Wilmington\u2019s past have never quite coalesced into a narrative whole, said David Walter, a freelance journalist who grew up here, missing \u201cwhatever that glue is.\u201d City officials make periodic stabs at creating the glue by rolling out new slogans. \u201cA Place to Be Somebody\u201d was around for years, replaced by \u201cWilmington, in the middle of it all.\u201d The latest is \u201cIt\u2019s Time,\u201d but that tends to provoke the question \u201cTime for what?\u201d and the mood is more \u201cIt\u2019s Biden.\u201d He is not exactly new. On the night that Mr. Biden won the presidency, people from Wilmington inundated their Facebook profiles with their Biden selfies. \u201cMy friends not from Delaware were like \u2018Oh my God! You met him?!\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Horney, who arrived two years ago to establish the epidemiology program at the University of Delaware. \u201cEverybody has met him.\u201d The inevitable flood tide of gimcrack Biden souvenirs has yet to start in earnest, but there are some. Scented candles named after Mr. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris cost $22 apiece at a gift shop abutting the Queen theater. Hers smells like lotus blossoms, inspired by her name, whereas his exudes the aroma of one of his favorite beverages: orange Gatorade. Mr. Biden trails only the du Ponts in getting his moniker slapped on things. The Amtrak station was named for him because he commuted by train to the U.S. Senate from Wilmington starting in 1973. The pool where he worked as a teenager bears his name. The Biden Welcome Center is the highway rest stop located along the roughly 30 miles that Interstate 95 slices through Delaware, between Pennsylvania and Maryland. William A. Sullivan, the chairman of the Greater Wilmington Convention and Visitors Bureau, dreams of installing a selfie-friendly Biden statue there to help entice more tourists off the freeway. \u201cMaybe that will come next,\u201d he said.",

    "article_text": "At Rally for Georgia Senators, Trump Focuses on His Own Grievances VALDOSTA, Ga. \u2014 One month before a pair of Georgia runoffs that will determine the Senate majority, President Trump used a rally for the Republican senators on Saturday to complain about his own loss last month, insisting he would still prevail and, with notably less ardor, encouraging voters here to re-elect the two lawmakers. Taking the stage for his first rally as a lame duck president, Mr. Trump immediately, and falsely, claimed victory in the presidential race. \u201cYou know we won Georgia, just so you understand,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump lost this state by just under 12,000 votes to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who won the White House with 306 electoral votes. But the president has persisted in his baseless claims that the final outcome remains in doubt. \u201cThey cheated and rigged our presidential election, but we\u2019ll still win,\u201d Mr. Trump said, offering no evidence but nonetheless prompting about 10,000 supporters gathered on the tarmac at a regional airport to chant, \u201cStop the Steal!\u201d Speaking for an hour and 40 minutes, the president did read a series of scripted lines about the two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, and repeatedly urged his supporters in Georgia to vote next month, even mentioning the deadlines for the mail-in ballots he has so often scorned. Yet he embedded those dutiful remarks of support in a deep thicket of conspiracy-mongering about his defeat and even aired a lengthy montage of video of clips from the conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network, which also depicted a sinister plot of electoral theft. Before he arrived in Valdosta, the president made no attempt to disguise his central priority as it relates to Georgia: overturning his loss in the state. He began the day with a telephone call with Gov. Brian Kemp, ostensibly to offer his condolences to the governor about the death in a car accident of a young man who was close to Mr. Kemp\u2019s family. But in truth, Mr. Trump used the call to urge Mr. Kemp, a Republican, to call the state legislature into session so the G.O.P. majorities could appoint new electors who would subvert the will of the state\u2019s voters when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 14. He has also called on Mr. Kemp to order an audit of signatures on ballots. At the rally, Mr. Trump amplified the critique he had been making of Mr. Kemp much of the day on Twitter, all but demanding that the governor overturn the will of the voters for him. \u201cYour governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing,\u201d the president said. \u201cStop it very easily.\u201d The crowd booed when he invoked Mr. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the two Georgia Republicans Mr. Trump has been demanding abet his effort to overturn Georgia\u2019s results. And they cheered when he turned to Representative Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican and Trump loyalist, and suggested he challenge Mr. Kemp in a gubernatorial primary in 2022. The president called the January races \u201cthe most important congressional runoff probably in American history\u201d and lashed the Democratic nominees, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, as \u201cfar-left liberals.\u201d But he didn\u2019t unspool the most biting attacks on them until about an hour into his remarks, and it was later still that he brought Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler to the stage for brief remarks. Mr. Perdue was nearly drowned out by the audience, which showered him with a \u201cFight for Trump\u201d chant that only grew louder when the two candidates handed the microphone back to the president. The president\u2019s supporters will not tolerate anything less than total fealty toward him. Mr. Trump\u2019s persistent lament about what he described as the \u201crigged\u201d election illustrated the quandary for Republicans. With Mr. Trump sowing distrust in Georgia\u2019s voting system, railing against the vote-counting machines the state used and falsely asserting that mail-in ballots were rife with fraud, he\u2019s giving Republicans in the state reason to question both voting by mail and in-person voting. If that prompts even a modest number of Republicans to sit out the Senate runoffs, especially in rural areas where Mr. Trump\u2019s support is strongest, it could be enough to alter the electoral math in the evenly divided state and tip the races to the Democrats. The president repeatedly sought to encourage Georgians to participate in the runoffs in the same breaths in which he railed against his own loss, offering a jarring, two-speeches-in-one presentation. \u201cYou got to get out and vote,\u201d he said just moments after venting that Republicans were purportedly \u201cnot nearly as vicious\u201d as Democrats when it came to stealing elections. In Valdosta, 250 miles south of Atlanta, supporters of the president began arriving by noon for the evening rally. Many of them had crossed the nearby state line from Florida and thus could not vote in the Senate races. The music, the red-white-and-blue stagecraft and Mr. Trump\u2019s heavily anticipated arrival were all familiar. But he showed little joy, and much of his speech was dedicated to nursing his grievances and was often reminiscent of the rambling, misinformation-filled, 45-minute video he delivered from the White House earlier in the week. \u201cI got more votes than any sitting president in history,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The president\u2019s willingness to campaign Saturday night in heavily conservative South Georgia \u2014 far from the Atlanta-area voters who rejected him last month \u2014 heartened Republican officials, who have been lobbying him to intervene in the runoffs in support of Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue. But aides worried, presciently, in the days leading to the appearance that he would go off script and attack Mr. Kemp, who has become the primary target of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter vitriol. Hoping to pacify Mr. Trump after Saturday\u2019s phone call, Mr. Kemp noted on Twitter that he had already called for an audit of the signatures on mail ballots \u201cto restore confidence in our election process.\u201d But Mr. Kemp\u2019s office has also said the governor does not have the power to unilaterally order a signature audit. Mr. Kemp did not attend the rally Saturday night because of the death of the family friend. Before Mr. Trump landed in Valdosta, Republicans took pains to emphasize the task at hand: the January runoffs. A mammoth video screen directed attendees to \u201cRequest Your Absentee Ballot Right Now!\u201d and directed them to the website to do so. And Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue both addressed the audience well before Air Force One touched down on a mild late autumn night. During a speech by Ms. Loeffler, who addressed the crowd nearly two hours before Mr. Trump spoke, the \u201cStop the steal\u201d chant broke out in the audience \u2014 in the cadence of the familiar \u201cLock her up\u201d chants that were popular during Mr. Trump\u2019s first run. Ms. Loeffler sought to redirect the crowd\u2019s energy to the runoff elections and away from the president\u2019s attempts to subvert the election results. \u201cYou\u2019re going to vote, right?\u201d she said. \u201cIf you vote, we will win. If you don\u2019t, we will lose America and what it\u2019s founded on.\u201d But as Elton John\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night\u2019s Alright (For Fighting)\u201d blared in advance of Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance, it was far from clear whom the crowd was more intent on directing its hostility toward \u2014 Democrats or the Georgia Republicans the president is scapegoating for his loss in the state. And outside the event, there were few indicators that the purpose of the rally was to elect Georgia\u2019s two Republican senators. Trump signs were ubiquitous, and the merchandisers outside were selling only Trump gear. The challenge for Republicans was evident in remarks from Mr. Perdue, who veered between encouraging the thousands in attendance to vote in the upcoming runoff and defending Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to advance his claims of fraud. \u201cI\u2019m going to fight for this president until he gets every ballot counted correctly and every illegal ballot thrown out,\u201d Mr. Perdue said. At the same time, he framed January\u2019s runoffs as a final chance for Republicans to issue a check against a Democratic administration. \u201cIf we win Georgia, we save America,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd thanks to you, we\u2019ll make sure the road to socialism never goes through the state of Georgia.\u201d Many in the audience had not accepted that Mr. Biden would be the next president. Jason Kresckey, who attended the rally with his wife, said he wanted to show support for the president. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s not going away,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that whole movement that he created was a movement that inspired a certain population of people. I just don\u2019t think that feeling is going anywhere soon.\u201d Michael D. Shear contributed reporting from Washington.",

Vice President Mike Pence appeared at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Friday and said the nation was facing a \u201cchallenging time\u201d but also \u201ca season of hope,\u201d with the approval of the first coronavirus vaccine coming as soon as next week. \u201cThank you to the men and women of C.D.C. who have literally poured their lives over the last 10 months into saving lives across America,\u201d said Mr. Pence, who wore a mask during the visit. But with the virus now in its darkest phase \u2014 and hospitalizations and daily caseloads shattering records \u2014 the White House remains largely silent on the devastation being wrought around the country and continues to do little to amplify guidance from the C.D.C. that could help stem the spread. And while Mr. Pence sought to offer an upbeat assessment, Dr. Henry Walke, who directs the C.D.C.\u2019s Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections, presented a far more sobering picture. \u201cHospitalizations are still rising and it\u2019s a real problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care providers are overstressed, beds are full.\u201d The C.D.C. issued new guidance on Friday urging state and local governments to put forth universal face mask directives in indoor settings outside the home, among other measures in the agency\u2019s first comprehensive list of strategies for combating the coronavirus. The agency also called for increased access to testing and quarantine for those who are exposed. Mr. Pence\u2019s C.D.C. visit came ahead of a \u201cvaccine summit\u201d at the White House on Tuesday featuring him, President Trump, government officials and industry workers. Two days later, a committee of outside experts will convene to make recommendations to the Food and Drug Administration about whether to grant emergency approval to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Thursday that he would implore Americans to wear masks for a little more than three months toward the beginning of his term. \u201cJust 100 days to mask,\u201d Mr. Biden told CNN. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a significant reduction.\u201d  But until he is sworn in on Jan. 20, Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to take direct action is limited.",

    "article_text": "Pelosi voices optimism on stimulus after McConnell agrees to compromise on a year-end spending bill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi flashed fresh optimism on Friday that the House and Senate could soon reach a bipartisan deal on an elusive pandemic stimulus plan after she and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, agreed to try to find an agreement that could be merged with an enormous year-end spending package. \u201cThat would be our hope because that is the vehicle leaving the station,\u201d Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, said at a news conference in the Capitol Friday morning, a day after her conversation with Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. The phone call marked their first conversation since the election. Though Ms. Pelosi conceded there were still obstacles to an agreement, she insisted there would be \u201csufficient time\u201d to close a deal before the Dec. 11 government funding deadline. She pointed to lower-than-expected job gains reported on Friday as an added accelerant. \u201cThere is momentum. There is momentum,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cThe tone of our conversations is one that is indicative of the decision to get the job done.\u201d Mr. McConnell expressed similar resolve on Thursday, although he stopped short of endorsing the $908 billion outline proposed by a bipartisan group of moderates that Ms. Pelosi has said should be the starting point for talks, instead pressing for a far smaller bill. Stimulus talks have been stalemated for months, with lawmakers unable to resolve differences over issues like liability protections for businesses, a Republican demand that Democrats have resisted, and providing federal aid to state and local governments, a top priority for Democrats that many Republicans oppose. They are also still struggling to resolve a number of policy disputes in the must-pass bills needed to keep the government funded beyond Dec. 11, though most involved in the process say that a resolution is feasible before the end of the year. After months of insisting they would not accept a slimmed-down relief bill, Democrats now appear poised to accept less than one third of the spending they initially proposed to prop up small businesses, help the uninsured and jobless, boost state and local governments, and meet immediate public health needs, leaving other priorities unaddressed until President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes office Jan. 20. The emerging compromise would revive lapsed federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week for 18 weeks, and provide billions of dollars in funding for small businesses, schools and the imminent distribution of a vaccine. While a bipartisan group of senators is expected to continue working on finalizing legislative text through the weekend, there remain a number of significant hurdles. The policy divides that have helped derail attempts to reach agreement earlier this year persist even as lawmakers circulate a tentative outline. Pressed on her reversal, Ms. Pelosi was defensive on Friday, saying her earlier, multitrillion-dollar proposals that the Senate called nonstarters were important parts of a negotiating strategy that may now yield results. She insisted that Mr. Biden\u2019s election and the looming arrival of two vaccines amounted to \u201ca total game-changer.\u201d \u201cPresident-elect Biden has said this package would be at best just a start,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we see it, as well. It is less money, but over a shorter period of time, and we need to do it to saves lives and livelihood with the hope that much more help is on the way.\u201d",

    "article_text": "The Winds Have Shifted in Pandemic Aid Negotiations WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s victory and faster-than-expected breakthroughs on a coronavirus vaccine have shifted the dynamics of stimulus talks in Congress, leading to the first serious bipartisan negotiations in months and empowering rank-and-file lawmakers who have long agitated for a compromise. With many cities and states reinstating lockdowns and the pace of job creation slowing, congressional lawmakers and Mr. Biden are facing pressure to provide a financial lifeline to the economy until a widespread vaccine forces the virus into submission. Mr. Biden has used public appearances in recent days to encourage lawmakers to compromise on a quick aid package that he said would only be a \u201cdown payment\u201d on what the incoming administration believes is necessary to mitigate the nation\u2019s economic pain in the months ahead. His team has pushed for Democrats to move off their hard-line negotiating stance for a trillion-dollar-plus bill, a stance that had made discussions with Republicans a nonstarter, and to embrace a smaller, bipartisan proposal. \u201cI think it should be passed,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the $908 billion proposal in a CNN interview broadcast Thursday evening, though he added, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask for more help when we get there to get things done.\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, announced such a shift on Wednesday, throwing their support behind a bipartisan $908 billion outline as a baseline for restarting negotiations. The plan, which rank-and-file lawmakers are still finalizing, would provide aid through March, offering a new wave of aid to small businesses and the unemployed, helping state and local governments and temporarily shielding businesses from some lawsuits amid the pandemic. In a sign of momentum, more Republicans also began coalescing around the $908 billion framework as a baseline for restarting negotiations, which had collapsed over disagreements about size and scope. On Thursday, Ms. Pelosi and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, spoke for the first time since the November election about another relief package, along with the spending bills needed to avert a government shutdown on Dec. 11. Mr. McConnell later told reporters that he and Ms. Pelosi are \u201cboth interested in getting an outcome\u201d on the two issues. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more hopeful that we\u2019ll get a bill,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He told reporters that he supported the bipartisan framework and that he had discussed coronavirus relief with President Trump at the White House on Thursday. But he added a dose of skepticism, given Mr. McConnell\u2019s decision to circulate a blueprint for a smaller relief package. \u201cI will support what Senator McConnell wants to propose,\u201d Mr. Graham said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t have any Democratic support. I\u2019m tired of doing show votes here.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s aides, along with Democrats on Capitol Hill, have become alarmed at the possibility that the economy could slip back into recession in the new year, as small businesses shutter and government benefits expire for millions of workers, handing him an even bigger economic challenge. But Mr. Biden is walking a delicate path in moving toward a possible compromise. He has called publicly for an immediate deal to provide more economic aid, even before he becomes president, and spoken favorably about the bipartisan framework. But he has not directly injected himself into talks between Ms. Pelosi and Mr. McConnell, as some lawmakers and aides stressed that any immediate deal would need Mr. Trump\u2019s signature \u2014 not Mr. Biden\u2019s. \u201cThe president-elect has been very clear in stating that something needs to happen, that the American people need relief,\u201d said Representative Abigail Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia and one of several House lawmakers who have worked on compromise legislation in an effort to break through the impasse. When asked if Mr. Biden should be more involved, she said she believed it better for Mr. Biden to play a supporting role while Mr. Trump remained president. \u201cHe will not be president until Jan. 20 \u2014 we can\u2019t wait until Jan. 20,\u201d Ms. Spanberger said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. He\u2019s not yet the president.\u201d The question of whether Mr. Trump would support a final compromise remains a wild card. Asked Thursday whether he agreed with Mr. McConnell that pandemic relief was \u201cin sight\u201d and whether he would support \u201cthis bill,\u201d Mr. Trump answered affirmatively. \u201cI will, and I think we are getting very close,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. While it was initially unclear which bill Mr. Trump was willing to sign, the White House later clarified that it was the outline of the smaller Republican bill, which Mr. McConnell is backing. Unlike in the fall, when both Republicans and Democrats had political incentives not to cut a deal, statements by Mr. Biden and his congressional allies in recent days show that lawmakers now see compromise as in their best interests. Depending on the outcome, stimulus plans could become a key issue in the Georgia runoff elections that will decide Senate control in January. Even with the renewed movement, a deal is far from assured. Mr. McConnell, who has continuously criticized the Democrats as wanting too expensive a package, acknowledged that it had been \u201cheartening to see a few hopeful signs\u201d this week in negotiations. But Mr. McConnell stopped short of endorsing the compromise plan in remarks on Thursday, admonishing lawmakers to focus on policy provisions where there was substantial agreement and signaling that he would not be quick to move off his targeted proposal. Even as he declared \u201ccompromise is within reach,\u201d he did not explicitly comment on the bipartisan framework. It also remains unclear what top Democrats would insist on in any final bill. But lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill acknowledged that a devastating spike in coronavirus cases across the country helped fuel momentum behind the discussions. Even a smaller, more immediate deal would fund an imminent distribution of a vaccine \u2014 a prospect that emerged after the election \u2014 and leave open the possibility for another relief package under a Biden administration. \u201cIt\u2019s the combination of the logistical costs and difficulties of vaccine distribution and the dramatic spike in cases, hospitalizations and deaths every day,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, a longtime close ally of Mr. Biden\u2019s who is involved in the discussions. \u201cIt is clear, to everyone I think, that we are in for a very hard winter before the vaccine is broadly available.\u201d Discussions toward a possible deal began among a loose bipartisan group of senators in mid-November, according to four officials familiar with the behind-the-scenes talks who requested anonymity to describe them. The participants agreed to meet over dinner at the Capitol Hill home of Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, on Nov. 17, two weeks after Election Day, to see if they could cobble together a plan. Senator Mark Warner, a moderate Democrat from Virginia, picked up the tab for food and drinks from San Lorenzo, a favorite of Washington\u2019s political class for Tuscan food. Fresh off a come-from-behind victory in Maine, Senator Susan Collins, a Republican, agreed to co-host. They were joined by three more Senate Democrats \u2014 Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the party\u2019s No. 2 \u2014 as well as two more Senate Republicans, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah. The conversation was productive enough that it quickly spilled into a nearly daily series of Zoom sessions that continued \u2014 sometimes for hours at a time \u2014 through the Thanksgiving holiday. Pleased at their progress, senators involved dryly dubbed themselves \u201cthe dinner group.\u201d Party leadership was kept informed, but senators did most of the negotiating themselves. Despite his more junior Senate status, Mr. Romney, his party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, emerged early on as a driver of the talks with Mr. Warner. He insisted that Republicans could go no higher than roughly $900 billion in new spending \u2014 a number that Ms. Collins floated as a possible compromise figure \u2014 and that liability protections for employers would have to be included in some form. The proposal was made final Monday night over a pizza dinner hosted by Mr. Romney in an oversize hearing room. It would provide $300 a week in additional benefits to the unemployed for 18 weeks, after a $600-per-week unemployment benefit lapsed in July. It includes $288 billion for struggling small businesses, restaurants and theaters and $160 billion for strapped cities and states, and most likely will include some liability protections for businesses. The framework, unveiled Tuesday, quickly received a boost from Mr. Biden. And speaking Thursday on CNN, he noted that he had faith in Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Coons to resolve the impasse, adding that he was \u201crelying on their judgment\u201d in determining \u201cthe most basic things that are needed now.\u201d Luke Broadwater, Thomas Kaplan and Michael D.

    "article_text": "Trump has raised $207.5 million since Election Day combined with the Republican Party. Even in defeat, President Trump continued to raise money at some of the fastest rates of the year, pulling in $207.5 million in the month since Election Day with the Republican National Committee as he has stoked unfounded fears of election fraud and made baseless claims to undermine the legitimacy of the election. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign apparatus has continued to aggressively solicit donations under the guise of supporting his various legal challenges to the election of Joseph R. Biden Jr., but as of now 75 percent of donations go to to a new political action committee that Mr. Trump formed in mid-November and 25 percent to the Republican Party. Only if a donor gives more than $6,000 do those funds go to Mr. Trump\u2019s formal \u201crecount\u201d account. His campaign did not release a breakdown of how the $207.5 million was divided, with funds split between the new PAC, paying off his campaign debts, the R.N.C. and two committees operated jointly by the party and the campaign. \u201cThese tremendous fund-raising numbers show President Trump remains the leader and source of energy for the Republican Party,\u201d Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement. Mr. Trump, who has not formally conceded the 2020 race but has begun talking about running again in 2024, has repeatedly challenged the results in court with virtually no success. In his statement, Mr. Stepien added that the money \u201calso positions President Trump to continue leading the fight to clean up our corrupt elections process in so many areas around the country, and to build on gains from the 2020 elections so we can take back the House and build on our Senate majority in 2022.\u201d The Thursday announcement came on a final filing deadline of the 2020 race with the Federal Election Commission, which covers the period from Oct. 15 to Nov. 23. During that period, the R.N.C., Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and their shared committees raised a combined $495 million, campaign officials announced. As of early evening, only the R.N.C. had filed its report, which showed it ended the period with $58.8 million cash on hand. As Mr. Trump has contested the results in multiple venues, the party had spent more than $6 million on legal bills, with $1.4 million going to the Jones Day law firm, $1.3 million to King and Spalding and more than $920,000 to Consovoy McCarthy.",

    "article_text": "A Trump Fed Pick Squeaks Through Senate Confirmation WASHINGTON \u2014 Christopher Waller, nominated by President Trump to the Federal Reserve\u2019s seven-member Board of Governors, was confirmed by a narrow margin on Thursday as Republican senators scramble to fill open slots before President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. assumes office. Mr. Waller, a regional Fed research official, had been up for Senate confirmation alongside Judy Shelton, whose long-held preference for some type of gold standard and apparent skepticism of Fed independence hurt her chances of confirmation. Mr. Waller made it through, but just barely, with a nearly party line vote of 48 to 47. Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, joined Democrats in voting against Mr. Waller. Mr. Waller\u2019s selection means that Mr. Biden will take office with a Fed stocked with picks from Mr. Trump, who has now chosen five of the central bank\u2019s six sitting officials, including appointing Jerome H. Powell as its chair. The board will have one remaining open slot if Ms. Shelton is not confirmed. While the sitting governors have varying time left in their 14-year terms, Mr. Waller was appointed to an unexpired slot that stretches through early 2030. The White House announced that it would tap Mr. Waller and Ms. Shelton in mid-2019, but their nominations \u2014 long treated as a pair \u2014 faced a roller-coaster confirmation process as senators grappled with misgivings over Ms. Shelton. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and a Republican of Kentucky, tried but failed to bring her nomination to a vote in November. Her path to confirmation became even less likely given the changing makeup of the Senate. Senator Mark Kelly, the newly elected Democrat from Arizona, was sworn in this week, and his likely no vote could kill Ms. Shelton\u2019s razor-thin chance of passing, because she already faced opposition from several Republicans. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, told reporters that Ms. Shelton\u2019s confirmation is \u201cunlikely\u201d after the changeover.

Jerome Powell was appointed as a governor by President Obama and subsequently appointed as chair by President Trump. Randal K. Quarles served as an acting governor for several months in 2018 pending his renomination. By Eleanor Lutz Though he was a conventional pick for the job, Mr. Waller\u2019s confirmation passed by the narrowest margin of any governor going back to at least 1980 and probably ever, based on data collected by a George Washington University professor, Sarah Binder. The partisan rancor shows how the process of appointing Fed governors \u2014 once drama free \u2014 has changed over the past decade. Both Mr. Trump and former President Barack Obama struggled to get nominees on the Fed board as political fights have erupted over who should fill seats on the powerful body, which plays a central role in setting interest rates and in shaping financial regulation. It also underlines the unusual path Mr. McConnell took in trying to push Fed officials through confirmation so late in the game. Mr. Waller is the first nominee ever confirmed during a lame-duck session, the period after an election but before a new administration enters the White House, according to the Fed historian Peter Conti-Brown. \u201cEverything has become hyper-politicized, and the Fed is no exception,\u201d said Mark Spindel, who with Ms. Binder wrote a book on politics at and around the Fed. \u201cFilling those spots with Trump appointees just limits what Biden can do.\u201d The Fed\u2019s Washington-based board members hold constant votes on monetary policy, while most of the 12 regional bank presidents rotate in and out of four voting seats. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is the exception, holding a permanent vote. The board members, called governors, also vote on the regulations that govern the nation\u2019s largest banks. Interest-rate setting is usually not a partisan exercise, and policy preferences do not split cleanly along ideological lines. But bank oversight tends to be more political, with Republicans favoring lighter oversight and Democrats pushing for more stringent rules. Despite the drama, Mr. Waller\u2019s confirmation was received as good news by many in the central banking community. He is a seasoned economist who has worked in academia and, most recently, as research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Mr. Waller\u2019s research has covered topics including central bank independence \u2014 \u201cthe key tool to ensure a government will not misuse monetary policy\u201d \u2014 and he has laid out a rationale for keeping borrowing costs cheap when prices are increasing slowly, as they have been in recent years. The Fed raises or lowers interest rates to slow or speed up the economy, hoping to keep inflation slow and stable while maximizing employment. Before joining the Fed in 2009, Mr. Waller was a professor in the economics department at Notre Dame. He has a doctorate from Washington State University. It is not clear whether he will be installed at the Fed in time for the central bank\u2019s Dec. 15-16 meeting. \u201cHe\u2019s been an excellent research director,\u201d Robert S. Kaplan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said of Mr. Waller, calling him an \u201cexcellent economist\u201d with a \u201ckeen mind.\u201d",

    "article_text": "President-Elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.: They Dare Not Speak His Name WASHINGTON \u2014 Funny what passes for a jolting revelation at the Capitol these days. Senator Mitch McConnell had just uttered a sentence that in more normal times would be received \u2014 and quickly forgotten \u2014 as just the kind of drab boilerplate that the Senate majority leader, a Kentucky Republican, is known for. \u201cI think we all know that after the first of the year, there\u2019s likely to be a discussion about some additional package of some size next year,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Tuesday as he discussed prospects for a coronavirus relief bill. At which point he delivered his bombshell: \u201cDepending on what the new administration wants to pursue.\u201d Aha! He said \u201cnew administration.\u201d Implying there would be an outgoing president. If President Trump had won re-election, as he keeps insisting \u2014 and which few Republican senators will publicly disabuse him of \u2014 there would be no \u201cnew administration\u201d to speak of. In other words, Mr. McConnell, in his own circuitous and perhaps unintentional way, was acknowledging that Mr. Trump had lost. Maybe he did not mean to be so forthcoming. It is, after all, a delicate verbal dance that Mr. McConnell and many of his fellow Republican senators are engaged in. They do not wish to alienate the apparently significant portion of the party\u2019s base that still believes that Mr. Trump won, or antagonize the president to the point that he torments them with future grudges, tweets and primary challengers from what will become the next de facto Republican home office, Mar-a-Lago. As such, when Mr. McConnell was asked directly about Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims, he reverted to his bland, inscrutable form. \u201cThe future will take care of itself,\u201d he said. This would seem beyond dispute. Privately, pretty much all Republican senators acknowledge that yes, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. will be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Jan. 20. This includes even Mr. Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters, like Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who admitted as much to Mark Becker, a former Republican official in the state. Mr. Becker recounted a conversation he had had with Mr. Johnson on Wednesday in The Bulwark, a website with a heavy bent toward \u201cNever Trump\u201d conservatism. When Mr. Becker asked Mr. Johnson why he had never acknowledged this election result in public, Mr. Johnson explained that to do so would be \u201cpolitical suicide.\u201d (It appears likely that Mr. Johnson believed this conversation was private.) In recent weeks, the unwillingness of most Senate and House Republicans to acknowledge an obvious election result has reached new levels of absurd. Whenever another prominent Republican official admits that Mr. Biden in fact won, the media updates the scoreboard like it\u2019s breaking news \u2014 as if a new state had been called on election night. Senators Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, Ben Sasse and Susan Collins declared this early, as did former President George W. Bush, his brother Jeb Bush, and a bunch of Republican governors and members of Congress. To reiterate what should now be indisputable: Mr. Biden won the election. Every serious news outlet in the United States has declared it. Nearly every lawsuit that Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team has filed disputing results in multiple states has failed \u2014 laughably in many cases. and Attorney General William P. Barr announced Tuesday that he had seen zero proof of fraud that would meaningfully affect the outcome. (Mr. Trump is reportedly furious at Mr. Barr for saying this.) Mr. Biden has received nearly seven million more votes than Mr. Trump, and he has amassed an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232, with virtually all ballots counted. It appeared last Sunday that Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, had joined the ranks of the sky-is-blue caucus when he referred to the \u201cBiden administration\u201d in an interview with CNN. This was of added significance because Mr. Blunt is the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees inaugural activities. \u201cWe are working with the Biden administration,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. \u201cLikely administration,\u201d he corrected himself. Ms. Bash pressed Mr. Blunt on whether this meant Mr. Biden was in fact the \u201cpresident-elect.\u201d Not so fast, he said. \u201cWell, the president-elect will be the president-elect when the electors vote for him,\u201d Mr. Blunt said, referring to the meeting of the Electoral College that is scheduled for Dec. 14. \u201cThere is no official job of president-elect,\u201d Mr. Blunt explained, though this had not stopped him from congratulating \u201cPresident-elect\u201d Donald J. Trump in a statement the day after Mr. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. In lieu of explicitly saying that Mr. Biden won, most Republicans are at least willing to engage in public discourse predicated on that reality. They have, for instance, repeatedly said that the two Senate seats up for grabs in a Georgia runoff election next month would determine which party controlled the chamber. If both Republican incumbents, Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, lose, the Senate would be 50-50, and Democrats would win the majority \u2014 an assumption premised on Senator Kamala Harris becoming the vice president and presiding over the Senate and being tasked with breaking tied votes. Several have weighed in on Mr. Biden\u2019s cabinet nominees. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, deemed the president-elect\u2019s choice to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden, \u201cradioactive.\u201d Mr. Cornyn also lamented that Mr. Biden\u2019s team had not sought \u201cconsultation\u201d from Republicans before making the choice (which would of course not be necessary if Mr. Biden had lost and was just spitballing). Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, hopped on Twitter on Wednesday to suggest a few good candidates to be the next secretary of agriculture \u201cif Biden becomes pres.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence even made the trip to Capitol Hill to swear in the newly elected Democratic senator from Arizona, Mark Kelly, while Mr. Pence\u2019s boss continued to rail against the results in that state (which were formally certified Monday). When asked after Mr. Kelly\u2019s swearing-in whether this meant he accepted the election results, Mr. Pence did not respond to reporters. Things get trickier when Republicans are asked directly whether they accept the results of the election, as reporters have been pressing them to do pretty much daily since Nov. 3. In normal times (how long before we retire that qualifier?), this question would yield some variation on the same obvious and broadly accepted response: \u201cYes.\u201d Alas, these are not normal times. \u201cThis has not been a conventional presidency,\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, summarized for reporters when he was asked why he and other Republicans have not raised concerns about the president\u2019s repeated and false claims that the election was \u201crigged\u201d or \u201cstolen.\u201d Since Mr. Trump was sworn in, Republicans have repeatedly sought verbal refuge in the \u201cunconventional\u201d nature of this presidency. This has been something of a blanket response to questions about his latest incendiary conduct. From Day 1, these statements have involved a willingness to indulge \u201calternative facts,\u201d as Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, said in defense of the untrue assertion by Sean Spicer, then the press secretary, that Mr. Trump had drawn \u201cthe largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period.\u201d In other words, an administration that began with a whopping assertion of \u201calternative facts\u201d is concluding with similarly outlandish claims about an alternative election result.

    "article_text": "Georgia Was a Big Win for Democrats. Black Women Did the Groundwork. RIVERDALE, Ga. \u2014 Decades before Joseph R. Biden Jr. flipped Georgia for the Democrats, Felicia Davis was a one-stop political organizing dynamo in Clayton County, canvassing for issues rather than candidates, for her community rather than a political party. The boom of her voice and the clarity of her convictions command respect. In her operation, even the teenagers are paid $15 an hour to knock on doors and distribute literature. Almost everyone is diligent: She is not someone to disappoint. \u201cI am unapologetically Black,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cMy agenda is Black. My community is Black. My county is Black. So what I do is Black. And for 20 years, we\u2019ve been trying to tell people what was possible.\u201d When Georgia turned blue for Mr. Biden this year after record voter turnout, it validated the political vision and advocacy of a group of Black women who have led a decades-long organizing effort to transform the state\u2019s electorate. Democrats celebrated their work registering new voters, canvassing and engaging in long-term political outreach. The achievement seemed to confirm mantras that have become commonplace in liberal politics, like \u201ctrust Black women\u201d and \u201cBlack women are the backbone of the Democratic Party.\u201d But the same women tell a more complicated story about their relationship with elected Democrats, national campaign officials and prominent political groups. For years, they said, their political vision was demeaned and distrusted. Donors and campaigns balked at the idea that Georgia was a battleground state worth investing in and that the organizers had picked up on demographic and political changes in their home state that others had missed. Now, with Georgia at the center of the political universe ahead of two pivotal Senate runoff elections in January, the organizers are asking Democrats: Will you embrace our approach now? \u201cWe weren\u2019t surprised that Georgia turned blue, because we\u2019ve been working on it for over 15 years,\u201d said Deborah Scott, the founder of Georgia Stand Up. When she started the group in 2004, she said, it was hard to persuade philanthropy groups and political foundations that focus on grass-roots organizing to consider Georgia. \u201cIt\u2019s been an uphill battle,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cBecause here, we\u2019re not just women, we\u2019re Southern women. And we\u2019re not just Southern women, we\u2019re Southern Black women.\u201d The most famous member of the club is Stacey Abrams, the former state lawmaker and candidate for governor who founded a voter registration group called the New Georgia Project. But there are many others \u2014 like Ms. Davis and Helen Butler, who was mentored by the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, the late civil rights leader \u2014 who have spent years working to turn out voters in Georgia. No single group delivered the state to Mr. Biden or can take credit for turnout there. In a presidential race decided by a razor-thin margin in Georgia, every piece mattered: increased turnout among young voters; outreach to Black, Latino and Asian-American communities; and a rejection of President Trump by some college-educated white voters who typically vote Republican. In the organizers\u2019 telling, the story of how Georgia voted does not start with Mr. Trump\u2019s election in 2016 or Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign investment this year. It begins a decade earlier, when a new generation of Black female leaders decided to create their own structures, fed up with a state party dominated by conservative \u201cDixiecrats\u201d and a moderate establishment that presumed the electorate could not change. They would identify, engage and turn out communities that had been traditionally overlooked \u2014 just as they had been themselves. It was a slow build that included close losses in the 2016 presidential election, the 2017 House special election in Georgia and Ms. Abrams\u2019s run in 2018. Ms. Butler, the executive director of the Georgia Coalition for the People\u2019s Agenda, said her group\u2019s political work showed how \u201cBlack women take care of the entire community, not just themselves.\u201d Nse Ufot, who leads the New Georgia Project, said the same national leaders now praising voter registration efforts in Georgia should reflect on how long it had taken them and groups like the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to invest in the Black women leading the push. \u201cNational campaign committees and presidential campaigns, like the D.N.C. and the D.C.C.C., would have their favorite pastor or their favorite community activists just run programs,\u201d she said. \u201cNo accountability. No data.\u201d Ms. Ufot added: \u201cIt was just their favorite pastor dude saying, \u2018Turn your people out.\u2019 When people like Helen Butler could actually run a proper program.\u201d \u201cFoundations were not supporting social justice and community building work here,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one was looking at what\u2019s happening in our rural areas, and no one\u2019s looking at the small ways that people were being cheated out of their own democracy by having these voter suppression laws. People weren\u2019t even paying attention, because they thought that\u2019s just the way it was here.\u201d For years, national Democratic campaigns have wrestled with whether Georgia and other Southern states were worthy investments, including during former President Barack Obama\u2019s race in 2012 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016. However, in the zero-sum environment of presidential politics, Democrats prioritized other states, including in the Upper Midwest and traditional battlegrounds like Ohio and Florida.  Asked about the criticism from Ms. Ufot and others, representatives for the D.N.C. and the D.C.C.C. declined to respond directly. A spokeswoman for the D.C.C.C. praised the organizing in Georgia and said that in recent years, the party had invested in local groups and campaign organizers with success. \u201cGeorgia doesn\u2019t turn blue without the determined organizing of activists and leaders in communities of color, particularly the Black community,\u201d said Robyn Patterson, the national press secretary for the D.C.C.C. \u201cHouse Democrats flipped two Trump-lean districts by investing early, hiring talented organizers with deep ties to their communities, and engaging the people of color who have spent years working to move Georgia forward.\u201d The arc of Georgia\u2019s transformation has become a road map for other states that are experiencing rapid demographic change and a catalyst for a new strategy in liberal politics. Versions of the New Georgia Project have popped up in Virginia, Texas and North Carolina as organizers try to create new, consistent voting blocs. This year, the progressive donor Susan Sandler gave $200 million to fund such efforts in the South and Southwest. An accompanying note said she had become convinced that investing in these groups \u2014 and not in campaigns \u2014 was the path to building long-term power among minority communities. Democratic groups and candidates have changed as well, with organizations like the D.C.C.C. garnering praise from Georgia Democrats this cycle for investing earlier in the state. Black Democrats running statewide campaigns in the South have reflected the message of Ms. Abrams, who embraced the racial and gender diversity of the party\u2019s base. The fact that the winning presidential ticket included a Black woman was another sign that the Democratic Party had come to recognize the most consistent part of its voting and organizing base, said Melanie Campbell, who convenes a group called the Black Women\u2019s Roundtable and is president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris\u2019s nomination \u201cwas that moment \u2014 for so many sisters \u2014 it was about more than just a ticket,\u201d Ms. Campbell said. \u201cIt was about having arrived to a place of being fully seen and fully respected as Black women.\u201d In a recent phone interview, Ms. Abrams, who is expected to run again for governor, recalled how she had driven to 150 of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties before her 2018 bid, learning about places where local leaders said the party could be more viable. \u201cBut when I got into those places, there was always someone there to meet me \u2014 who had been waiting for someone to come to help connect and help them build this network,\u201d she said. \u201cSo whether it was finding Black voters in South Georgia, and working with Black immigrants in Gwinnett, or working with the A.A.P.I. community, or going to North Georgia and meeting with more and more Latino voters.\u201d (A.A.P.I. refers to Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.) Ms. Abrams also said she disliked \u201ctrust Black women\u201d as a motto because it didn\u2019t reflect the diverse coalition that had brought change to the state. A New York Times analysis of Georgia voters found that turnout had increased among minority communities and in the diverse suburbs but that the biggest shift to Democrats was among white college graduates and wealthier residents. \u201cI appreciate the necessity of that battle cry,\u201d Ms. Abrams said. \u201cAnd in my approach, in Georgia in particular, Black women have been instrumental. But I chafe at this idea that we then objectify one group as both savior and as responsible party.\u201d Still, it was Black women who laid the organizing framework in Georgia, and who are doing so again ahead of the Senate runoffs. Ms. Ufot\u2019s group held a small celebration on the Saturday after Election Day, after Mr. Biden crossed the threshold of 270 electoral votes, but was back to organizing by that Monday. In Clayton County, south of Atlanta, Ms. Davis\u2019s small army of canvassers is encouraging residents to participate in the runoffs but is also focusing on a down-ballot race for the state\u2019s public service commission. Many voter registration efforts in Georgia are run by nonprofit, apolitical organizations, including the People\u2019s Agenda, Georgia Stand Up and the New Georgia Project, that target historically disadvantaged communities and nonwhite voters. Because those demographic groups tend to break for Democrats, and given that leaders like Ms. Butler and Ms. Ufot have professional and personal histories with people like Ms. Abrams, Republicans have sometimes cast the groups as unofficial wings of the Democratic Party \u2014 which has placed them under intense legal and journalistic scrutiny. The women who lead these groups say they take pride in their legal and operational independence and denounce the transactional nature of political campaigns and candidates. Their message, they say, is about turning passive constituents of a democratic society into active participants. It is an enduring effort that begins before the flood of candidate ads and party literature and continues long after. Ms. Butler, the head of the People\u2019s Agenda, said what had given her the most pride this year was not the Democratic success in Georgia, but the high turnout and continued ascendance of nonwhite voters. \u201cThe more people that get engaged in this, the more diverse opinions we have, I think we come out with better elected officials,\u201d she said. But those who are explicit about their partisan leanings said a blue Georgia was vindication after years of what-ifs and close calls. The next time they ask for investment and trust, it will be easier, they said. And for Black women everywhere, there is now a model for expanding their political power. \u201cWe are the home of Scarlett O\u2019Hara and \u2018Gone With the Wind,\u2019\u201d Ms. Davis said, referring to the 1936 plantation epic that was set in Clayton County. \u201cSo you have to think about it like that. What we\u2019re doing here is putting to rest some of the worst aspects of old Southern culture. And that\u2019s a powerful thing.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Meet Biden\u2019s Energy and Climate Cabinet Contenders WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s environment and energy team \u2014 facing a narrowly divided Congress and a hostile Republican leadership \u2014 will need creativity and perseverance if Mr. Biden is to follow through on his ambitious promises to address climate change. In November, Mr. Biden announced that former Secretary of State John Kerry, who made climate change a signature diplomatic issue during the Obama administration, will become an international \u201cclimate envoy.\u201d Mr. Biden also intends to name a high level domestic policy adviser on climate change this month. But the agency heads, whose names will be announced in the coming days, will be the ones tasked to find a path around Congress with regulations that can cut planet-warming emissions and survive judicial review. Here are the leading candidates: Mr. Biden\u2019s top candidate to lead the agency is Ms. Nichols, California\u2019s climate and clean air regulator, according to four people familiar with the matter. She said in an interview that she would accept the job. Ms. Nichols is the architect of her state\u2019s cap-and-trade climate change law, which capped greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, then allowed utilities to buy and sell emissions credits to keep polluting at lower levels. She also helped craft California\u2019s tough regulations on climate-warming auto emissions, which served as a model for President Barack Obama\u2019s federal climate policies, before they were rolled back by President Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be important to quickly reverse and stop a very large number of actions that were done by the Trump administration, and then to restore the agency\u2019s scientific basis for its work,\u201d Ms. Nichols said in a recent interview. Also in the running: Currently president of the National Wildlife Federation, Mr. O\u2019Mara is seen by many on the Biden transition team as a strong second choice to lead the E.P.A. if it appears that Ms. Nichols cannot win enough Republican Senate votes to be confirmed for the job. If confirmed, Mr. O\u2019Mara, 41, would be one of the youngest heads of a cabinet agency in recent history; he has long been described as a \u201cwhiz kid,\u201d fluent in complex environmental policy issues. Mr. O\u2019Mara has deep ties to Mr. Biden\u2019s home state of Delaware, and to the Biden family. As head of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control from 2009 to 2014, he worked closely with Mr. Biden\u2019s son Beau, then the state\u2019s attorney general. He has also served as head of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state cap-and-trade program, and served on Mr. Obama\u2019s Task Force on Climate Adaptation and Preparedness. The former mayor of Greenville, Miss., and a regional E.P.A. administrator in the Obama administration, Ms. McTeer Toney currently serves as senior director of Moms Clean Air Force, an environmental group that fought President Trump\u2019s efforts to scale back or eliminate air, water and climate change regulations. A top choice of liberal activists, she would be the second Black woman to lead the E.P.A. The White House Council on Environmental Quality coordinates and helps shape environmental policy across an administration. If confirmed, Mr. Ali would focus attention on racial disparities in federal environmental policy. With more than 20 years of experience at the E.P.A., Mr. Ali currently serves as vice president of environmental justice, climate and community revitalization for the National Wildlife Federation. He founded the agency\u2019s Office of Environmental Justice and under the Obama administration served as a senior adviser to the administrator Gina McCarthy on environmental justice issues. Also in the running: Ms. Mallory served as the general counsel to Mr. Obama\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality, after more than 15 years at the E.P.A., where she ultimately served as the agency\u2019s principal deputy general counsel. She currently is the director of regulatory policy at the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit group that has fought many of Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory efforts in court. Mr. Connor, a former deputy secretary of the Interior in the Obama administration, would be extremely qualified for the post. He worked in the department throughout the Clinton administration, including four years as director of the Secretary\u2019s Indian Water Rights Office. He later worked for then-Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, on land, water, energy and Native American issues before returning to Interior during the Obama administration. He is also a citizen of the Taos Pueblo, a sovereign nation near Taos, N.M., that is one of the country\u2019s 574 federally recognized Native American tribes. A coalition of Democrats, Native Americans and liberal activists have been urging Mr. Biden to nominate a Native American to head the agency, a move that would make history. A Native American has never been in a presidential cabinet, and the Interior Department has for much of the nation\u2019s history governed huge swaths of federal land, especially in the West, and often dislodged and abused Native Americans. Also in the running: The campaign for a Native American Interior secretary was built around one candidate, Ms. Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico, who in 2018 became one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress. But many of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers fear that she lacks the experience to manage the sprawling complex agency. Ms. Haaland nonetheless remains a contender, in part because of her political star power. Among those campaigning for her are the Lakota People\u2019s Law Action Center and the actor and environmentalist Mark Ruffalo, who posted a video on Twitter with tribal leaders speaking on her behalf. Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who chairs the committee that oversees the Interior Department, sent a letter to Mr. Biden signed by at least 50 colleagues urging the nomination of Ms. Haaland, who has served on Mr. Grijalva\u2019s Natural Resources Committee since her arrival in Congress last year. A New Mexico senator who will retire at the end of the year, Mr. Udall has fought to protect federal property from oil and gas drilling and has promoted the designation of wilderness areas in his home state. If Mr. Udall is picked, he will be keeping up a family tradition: His father, Stewart Udall, served as Interior secretary during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. A nuclear physicist who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s second energy secretary remains in the running to return to his old post. Dr. Moniz, now president and chief executive officer of the Energy Futures Initiative, a research organization, served as an informal adviser to Mr. Biden during the campaign and several people who worked under him at the Energy Department said they would be thrilled to do so again. But Dr. Moniz has detractors. Liberal groups have protested some of the positions he has taken since leaving government, including a post on the board of Southern Company, an electric and gas utility company. They also objected to his endorsements of nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage as ways to fight climate change because they believe climate policy should focus only on renewable sources like wind and solar. Though his biggest legacy is helping to secure the Iran nuclear deal, Dr. Moniz played a key behind-the-scenes role in the Paris Agreement on climate change as well, working to make clean energy a core part of the accord. Under Mission Innovation, a parallel agreement to the Paris deal, 19 nations and the United States agreed to double research and development spending on carbon emissions-free energy. President Trump effectively backed out of the pact when he abandoned the Paris Agreement. Also in the running: Dr. Majumdar, who currently is heading Mr. Biden\u2019s transition team for the Energy Department, could become its secretary. Dr. Majumdar moved to the United States from India to earn a doctorate in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, and went on to become the first director of Energy Department\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy program, where he tried to build strong relationships with Republicans as well as Democrats. Currently Dr. Majumdar leads the Precourt Institute for Energy at Stanford University. One of the earliest female Rhodes scholars, Ms. Sherwood-Randall has a deep background in nuclear weapons, the largest part of the Energy Department\u2019s work, as well as challenges to the country\u2019s electric grid. A former adviser to Mr. Biden when he was in the Senate, Ms. Sherwood-Randall served in both the Clinton and Obama administrations working on foreign policy and national security issues. From 2014 to 2017 she was the deputy secretary of energy, leading the National Nuclear Security Administration. She also headed up an initiative to address challenges to the power grid. Mr. Zaidi, New York State\u2019s deputy secretary of energy and environment, is widely considered the front-runner for the role of domestic climate change coordinator. The new position would require someone who could work with cabinet secretaries and other high-level figures like Mr. Kerry. Mr. Zaidi served as associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under Mr. Obama where he helped design the White House Climate Action Plan, a blueprint for cutting emissions. The former governor of Michigan and an adviser to Hillary Clinton on energy has been floated as a potential secretary of energy. But she\u2019s also under serious consideration for the domestic climate policy coordinator position, according to two people who said her years of executive experience make her an attractive pick.",

    "article_text": "Biden Made Sure \u2018Trump Is Not Going to Be President for Four More Years\u2019 President-elect Joe Biden was in a good mood as we talked on the phone Tuesday evening for an hour \u2014 he in Delaware and I in Bethesda, Md. He apologized, though, for being late. He had been following the breaking news that Attorney General William Barr had announced that the Justice Department had not uncovered any significant fraud that could have affected the results of the presidential election. It\u2019s all over. Biden joked that Barr had just called him, \u201casking if I can get him in the witness protection program for endorsing me.\u201d Considering the Trump team\u2019s hurricane of dishonest claims about the election, the president-elect was entitled to a little laugh at its expense. Otherwise, he was all business. Biden had a lot to say about how he intends to approach the current Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and his Republican colleagues in order to get his cabinet nominees \u2014 and as much of his agenda as possible \u2014 through the Senate; how he intends to reshape U.S.-China strategy; and why he is ready to return to the Iran nuclear deal, if Iran does, and end President Trump\u2019s sanctions on Iran. Biden also spoke in depth about his strategy to connect with rural Americans, who have become estranged from the Democratic Party. I did ask one personal question: What has it been like to win the presidency under such weird circumstances \u2014 with a deadly pandemic and an infodemic of Trump propaganda falsely claiming that the election was rigged? \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve done something good for the country by making sure that Donald Trump is not going to be president for four more years,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut there\u2019s been no moment of elation. It kind of reminds me of what\u2019s going on with all my grandkids. You know, here I got a granddaughter who graduates with honors from Columbia. There\u2019s no commencement. I\u2019m the commencement speaker. It\u2019s virtual. These kids are graduating with no parties. It\u2019s just one of those moments. There\u2019s a lot of work to do. I\u2019m just focused on getting some things done as quickly as I can.\u201d Exactly how much he will get done will depend to a large degree on two things, Biden noted. One is how Republicans in the Senate and the House behave once Trump is truly gone from power. And the other is how McConnell behaves if he continues to control the Senate. Biden\u2019s top priority, he said, is getting a generous stimulus package through Congress, even before he takes office. We are courting serious long-term economic harm if we don\u2019t deal with the fact that \u201cyou have over 10 million people out there who are worried [how] they can pay their next mortgage payment,\u201d and \u201cyou have a significantly higher number of people who have no ability to pay their rent.\u201d When people \u201care out of the work force too long, you know, that makes it a hell of a lot harder for them to get back in the work force,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMany of them are losing years and years of opportunity.\u201d The same is true when kids miss significant time in school. \u201cThey don\u2019t just lose that semester,\u201d he said. \u201cThey end up sometimes two and three years behind.\u201d A generous stimulus will actually generate economic growth without long-term fiscal harm if in the future \u201ceverybody pays their fair share, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d he insisted. \u201cAnd by that fair share, I mean there\u2019s no reason why the top tax rate shouldn\u2019t be 39.6 percent, which it was in the beginning of the Bush administration. There\u2019s no reason why 91 Fortune 500 companies should be paying zero in taxes.\u201d But the big question is whether he can get it past McConnell today or tomorrow if the Republicans continue to hold the Senate. A significant number of Republican senators could decide that they want to become deficit hawks again under a President Biden, after four years of uncontrolled spending under Trump that has brought the national debt to record highs. Biden was careful about how he talked about McConnell, who has been careful not to call Biden \u201cpresident-elect.\u201d Biden obviously wants to keep the prospects of cooperation open \u2014 but also make clear that he may have more leverage with the American people than the G.O.P. realizes if Senate Republicans opt for full-on obstruction. \u201cLet me put it this way,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a number of things that when McConnell controlled the Senate that people said couldn\u2019t get done, and I was able to get them done with [him]. I was able to get them to, you know, raise taxes on the wealthy.\u201d \u201cI think there are trade-offs, that not all compromise is walking away from principle,\u201d Biden added. \u201cHe knows me. I know him. I don\u2019t ask him to embarrass himself to make a deal.\u201d At the same time, if Republicans clearly \u201clet all this go down the drain\u201d just so a Biden administration will not get a win, that \u201cmay have an impact on the prospect of Republicans running for re-election in 2022.\u201d \u201cWhen you have cops and firefighters and first responders across the board being laid off, when you\u2019re not getting the kind of distribution of vaccines out to rural America,\u201d he said, \u201cit has to have some consequences.\u201d Having been through a lot of political seasons, Biden added, the world could change a lot for Republican lawmakers once Trump is gone, although he certainly will not be forgotten. \u201cMy favorable rating is now 55 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is down to 42 percent.\u201d A significant number of independents and some Republicans could start to look at the world very differently in the next few weeks, he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure [they] can sustain the position that we\u2019re not going to do anything to help the circumstances of keeping businesses open, making sure we could open our schools safely. It is kind of hard to go home\u201d if you are a Republican senator who says \u201clet the states go bankrupt.\u201d Republicans live in those states, too. On foreign policy, Biden made two significant points. First, I asked him whether he stood by his views on the Iran nuclear deal that he articulated in a Sept. 13 essay on CNN.com. He answered, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard, but yeah.\u201d He had written that \u201cif Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations,\u201d and lift the sanctions on Iran that Trump imposed. The Iranians are clearly hoping for that. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said on Nov. 17 that a return to full implementation by the United States and Iran can be \u201cdone automatically\u201d and \u201cneeds no negotiations.\u201d The nuclear deal was signed in 2015. Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in May 2018, reimposing crippling oil sanctions on Iran, claiming that it was a bad deal to begin with and that Iran was cheating \u2014 which was not the view of our European allies or international inspectors. The view of Biden and his national security team has been that once the deal is restored by both sides, there will have to be, in very short order, a round of negotiations to seek to lengthen the duration of the restrictions on Iran\u2019s production of fissile material that could be used to make a bomb \u2014 originally 15 years \u2014 as well as to address Iran\u2019s malign regional activities, through its proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Ideally, the Biden team would like to see that follow-on negotiation include not only the original signatories to the deal \u2014 Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France, Germany and the European Union \u2014 but also Iran\u2019s Arab neighbors, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Earlier this week, I wrote a column arguing that it would be unwise for the United States to give up the leverage of the Trump-imposed oil sanctions just to resume the nuclear deal where it left off. We should use that leverage to also get Iran to curb its exports of precision-guided missiles to its allies in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq, where they threaten Israel and several Arab states. I still believe that. Biden and his advisers are aware of that argument, and do not think it is crazy \u2014 but for now they insist that America\u2019s overwhelming national interest is to get Iran\u2019s nuclear program back under control and fully inspected. In their view, Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon poses a direct national security threat to the United States and to the global nuclear weapons control regime, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \u201cLook, there\u2019s a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilizing the region,\u201d Biden said. But the fact is, \u201cthe best way to achieve getting some stability in the region\u201d is to deal \u201cwith the nuclear program.\u201d If Iran gets a nuclear bomb, he added, it puts enormous pressure on the Saudis, Turkey, Egypt and others to get nuclear weapons themselves. \u201cAnd the last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nuclear capability.\u201d Then, Biden said, \u201cin consultation with our allies and partners, we\u2019re going to engage in negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran\u2019s nuclear constraints, as well as address the missile program.\u201d The U.S. always has the option to snap back sanctions if need be, and Iran knows that, he added. There is going to be a lot of debate about this in the coming months. On China, he said he would not act immediately to remove the 25 percent tariffs that Trump imposed on about half of China\u2019s exports to the United States \u2014 or the Phase 1 agreement Trump inked with China that requires Beijing to purchase some $200 billion in additional U.S. goods and services during the period 2020 and 2021 \u2014 which China has fallen significantly behind on. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any immediate moves, and the same applies to the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to prejudice my options.\u201d He first wants to conduct a full review of the existing agreement with China and consult with our traditional allies in Asia and Europe, he said, \u201cso we can develop a coherent strategy.\u201d \u201cThe best China strategy, I think, is one which gets every one of our \u2014 or at least what used to be our \u2014 allies on the same page. It\u2019s going to be a major priority for me in the opening weeks of my presidency to try to get us back on the same page with our allies.\u201d China\u2019s leaders had their issues with Trump, but they knew that as long as he was president, the United States could never galvanize a global coalition against them. Biden\u2019s strategy, if he can pull it off, will not be welcome news for China. While Trump was focused on the trade deficit with China, with little success, despite his trade war, Biden said his \u201cgoal would be to pursue trade policies that actually produce progress on China\u2019s abusive practices \u2014 that\u2019s stealing intellectual property, dumping products, illegal subsidies to corporations\u201d and forcing \u201ctech transfers\u201d from American companies to their Chinese counterparts. When dealing with China, Biden concluded, it is all about \u201cleverage,\u201d and \u201cin my view, we don\u2019t have it yet.\u201d Part of generating more leverage, though, is developing a bipartisan consensus at home for some good old American industrial policy \u2014 massive, government-led investments in American research and development, infrastructure and education to better compete with China \u2014 and not just complain about it. Both Democratic and Republican senators have draft bills calling for such a strategy. The U.S. semiconductor industry in particular has been lobbying for such an approach. \u201cI want to make sure we\u2019re going to fight like hell by investing in America first,\u201d said Biden. He ticked off energy, biotech, advanced materials and artificial intelligence as areas ripe for large-scale government investment in research. \u201cI\u2019m not going to enter any new trade agreement with anybody until we have made major investments here at home and in our workers\u201d and in education, he said. And this time, he insisted, rural America will not be left behind. There is no way Democrats can go another four years and lose almost every rural county in America. For their sake and the country\u2019s, Democrats have to figure out what is going on there and speak to rural voters more effectively. \u201cYou know, it really does go to the issue of dignity, how you treat people,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI think they just feel forgotten. I think we forgot them.\u201d \u201cI respect them,\u201d Biden added, and he plans to prove it by \u201ctackling the virus\u201d in \u201cred and blue areas alike.\u201d We have \u201cgot to end the rural health care crisis right now by building on Obamacare, assuming it survives at all, with a public option [and] automatically enroll people eligible for Medicaid. There\u2019s strong support for that \u2014 and particularly [from] people in rural states, like Texas and North Carolina, that reject expansion. We can boost funding. I visited 15 rural hospitals. And the biggest problem is there\u2019s not enough reimbursement for them to be able to keep open.\u201d And they are often the biggest employer in that town or city. A lot of these rural hospitals and clinics could benefit from telemedicine, but they don\u2019t have the broadband connectivity. \u201cWe should be spending $20 billion to put broadband across the board,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe have got to rebuild the middle class,\u201d but \u201cespecially in rural America.\u201d Before we signed off, I asked the president-elect just how he reacted to Republican senators threatening not to confirm Neera Tanden as director of the Office of Management and Budget, because of her trail of nasty tweets about Republicans. Should nasty tweets be disqualifying in this day and age? \u201cThat disqualifies almost every Republican senator and 90 percent of the administration,\u201d Biden chuckled. \u201cBut by the way, she\u2019s smart as hell. Yeah, I think they\u2019re going to pick a couple of people just to fight [over] no matter what.\u201d Biden closed by reflecting on the ugliness of the last four years \u2014 first seeing the glass half empty but then deciding in the end, who knows, maybe it\u2019s half full. \u201cSeventy-two million people is a lot of people to vote for\u201d Trump, he said. But maybe, just maybe when Trump is gone from the immediate scene, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that ugliness stays. There may be 20 percent of it. Twenty five percent of it, I don\u2019t know.\u201d But some portion has to come back to a place where we can collaborate. \u201cWe got to figure out how to work together,\u201d he said. Otherwise, \u201cwe\u2019re in real trouble.\u201d The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We\u2019d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

    "article_text": "A day after Justice Dept. found no evidence of widespread election fraud, Trump posts video filled with falsehoods. Increasingly isolated in the White House, President Trump on Wednesday released a 46-minute videotaped speech filled with lies in which he spoke angrily about a \u201crigged\u201d election even though his own attorney general and election officials across the country have attested to his loss. Mr. Trump posted a short, two-minute version of the speech on Twitter, recorded in the Diplomatic Room of the White House and delivered behind a lectern bearing the presidential seal, with a link to the full version on his Facebook page. Saying that his remarks \u201cmay be the most important speech I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d the president once again refused to concede defeat in his bid for re-election almost one month after Election Day. Instead, he repeated a long series of false assertions about voter fraud, accusing Democrats of a conspiracy to steal the presidency. Twitter quickly labeled the post as \u201cdisputed.\u201d Facebook added a note that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who received almost 81 million votes and 306 electoral votes, is the projected winner of the election. The video, which a White House official said was recorded last week, was the in-person embodiment of Mr. Trump\u2019s staccato tweets during the past three weeks: one falsehood after another about voting irregularities in swing states, Democratic conspiracies, attacks on state officials and signature verifications. The president\u2019s rambling assertions in the video were drastically undercut on Tuesday, when Attorney General William P. Barr told The Associated Press that despite inquiries by the Justice Department and the F.B.I., \u201cto date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d Mr. Trump continued to rage about voting irregularities in the video, a day after a Republican elections official in Georgia lashed out at him, saying the president was inspiring violence and was to blame for a wave of death threats. \u201cMr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language,\u201d said Gabriel Sterling, a voting systems manager in Georgia. \u201cStop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence.\u201d At the end of the video, Mr. Trump improbably described himself as the defender of America\u2019s election system, saying he had been told that the single most important accomplishment of his presidency would be protecting the integrity of the voting system. It was unclear why Mr. Trump waited until Wednesday to release the video. But he made it public after a series of rebukes by members of his own party who have increasingly abandoned him as he clings to power by making baseless assertions about voter fraud that have been roundly rejected. The president\u2019s legal team, led by his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, has lost dozens of lawsuits in courts across the country while making wild allegations without any proof to back them up. Some of the president\u2019s key Republican allies on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have urged him to move on in recent days. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, referred this week to the \u201cnew administration\u201d that would be taking over next year, a clear signal to Mr. Trump that his time in office was coming to an end. Lawmakers in both parties have also signaled that they may be willing to defy his threat to veto the military spending bill unless Congress eliminates a legal provision that provides liability protection for social media companies. Those social media platforms remain the president\u2019s favorite method for disseminating false and misleading information. Within a few hours, his tweet had been \u201cliked\u201d by almost 134,000 Twitter users, and his Facebook video had been shared 93,000 times.",

    "article_text": "The Arizona Democrat Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, joined the Senate today, narrowing Republicans\u2019 majority. Senator Mark Kelly is no stranger to lonely missions. As a former astronaut, he traveled millions of miles in space piloting shuttles to the International Space Station on four different missions, one of them just months after an assassination attempt nearly claimed the life of his wife, former Representative Gabrielle Giffords. On Wednesday, he began another kind of lonely journey, becoming the first of a new class to be formally sworn into the Senate and one of just two Democrats to unseat a Republican incumbent this year. Last month, Mr. Kelly won a special election to serve the remainder of the late Senator John McCain\u2019s term. His arrival whittled Senate Republicans\u2019 narrow majority to 52-48, a distinction for Mr. Kelly that adds to the outsize profile he will wield as a freshman senator. It also dooms the already fraught nomination of Judy Shelton, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors, whom the White House had hoped to confirm before the end of the lame-duck session. Mr. Kelly\u2019s victory over the Republican senator Martha McSally meant that for the first time since the 1950s, both Arizona senators are Democrats, underscoring the shifting demographics and politics of a former conservative stronghold. He joins Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected in 2018. On the campaign trail, Mr. Kelly leaned hard into his biography as a former Navy captain and astronaut, adopting the mantra \u201cFull speed ahead.\u201d He had a compelling surrogate in Ms. Giffords, who spoke in personal terms about his commitment to both his country and to her, gesturing in an advertisement to how he had \u201chelped me through my darkest moments.\u201d \u201cEveryone continues to be inspired by Gabby\u2019s recovery, by Mark\u2019s devotion, and the courage it took for their family to re-enter public life and public service,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said on Wednesday. Mr. Kelly will work out of Mr. McCain\u2019s old office, and on Tuesday, Mr. Kelly and his family visited Mr. McCain\u2019s grave at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis. \u201cIt\u2019s not often that we get to meet our heroes, and even less often that we get to call them a friend,\u201d Mr. Kelly said in his victory speech. \u201cI got to do that with Senator McCain.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Iran Moves to Increase Uranium Enrichment and Bar Nuclear Inspectors Iran responded Wednesday to the assassination of its top nuclear scientist by enacting a law ordering an immediate ramping up of its enrichment of uranium to levels closer to weapons-grade fuel. The measure also requires the expulsion of international nuclear inspectors if American sanctions are not lifted by early February, posing a direct challenge to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. It was not clear whether the action was the totality of the Iranian response to the killing of the scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, whom American and Israeli intelligence agencies regarded as the guiding force of past efforts by Tehran to design a nuclear weapon, or whether more was to come. Iranian officials have vowed to avenge his killing. The new law orders Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Agency to resume enriching uranium to a level of 20 percent immediately, returning Iran\u2019s program to the maximum level that existed before the 2015 nuclear agreement reached with the Obama administration. Uranium enriched to that level would give Iran the ability to convert its entire stockpile to bomb-grade levels within six months. Despite the lag time, the order to start the process may be seen by the Trump administration as a provocation in its waning days. Just three weeks ago, after news of modest advances in the size of Iran\u2019s nuclear stockpile, Mr. Trump asked his advisers about military options to stop the country from producing the fuel. He was talked out of considering an attack by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, one of the fiercest of the Iran hawks in the administration, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Mark A. Milley, among other senior officials. The new law also sets a two-month deadline for oil and banking sanctions against Iran to be lifted before inspectors are barred, creating a potential crisis for the early days of the Biden administration. The inspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, a branch of the United Nations, have been the main public source of information about the progress of Iran\u2019s program. The timing seems deliberately intended to press Mr. Biden to re-enter the nuclear deal with Iran immediately upon taking office. Mr. Biden has said he would be willing to do so, at least as a starting point, if Iran once again respected the limitations of the 2015 deal. The speaker of Iran\u2019s Parliament, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, a former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said the measure was meant to send the West a message in the aftermath of the assassination that the \u201cone-way game is over.\u201d Iran\u2019s Parliament, dominated by conservatives, initially passed the law in an angry session on Tuesday in which lawmakers fumed over the killing of Mr. Fakhrizadeh. A physicist and a high-ranking official in the Defense Ministry, he was killed on Friday in a complex ambush, the details of which are still being debated. A number of intelligence officials have said Israel was responsible for the attack, though the Israeli government has remained silent. \u201cThe criminal enemy will not feel remorse unless we show a fierce reaction,\u201d Mr. Qalibaf said. Lawmakers stood up in the chamber with fists in the air, chanting \u201cdeath to Israel\u201d and \u201cdeath to America\u201d as they passed the bill in a televised session. The law was ratified Wednesday by Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, an appointed body that oversees the elected government. President Hassan Rouhani, whose government negotiated the 2015 Iran accord over the objection of Iranian hard-liners, had opposed the legislation, calling it counterproductive. \u201cThe government does not agree with this legislation and considers it damaging for diplomacy,\u201d he said Wednesday before the measure was ratified. His government is now obliged to carry out the law, though outside experts noted that it could slow-walk the effort, citing technical challenges. And ramping production up to the levels required in the bill would require revisions in the infrastructure deep inside Iran\u2019s main nuclear facility at Natanz \u2014 the same one that was hit by a devastating Israeli-American cyber-strike more than a decade ago. Uranium enriched to 20 percent purity is a quick hop to bomb-grade uranium, which is roughly 90 percent pure. But getting from the current levels of 4 or 5 percent enrichment to 20 percent is a far bigger leap than the final move to bomb-grade fuel. Iran has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, though American intelligence assessed that Iran had a fully active, secret weapons program run by Mr. Fakhrizadeh until 2003. Israeli officials and some American intelligence officials believe that program has continued at a lower level; the scientist was slapped with new American sanctions in recent years. By mandating a restoration of production and enrichment levels, the new law essentially wipes away the last of the main constraints negotiated by President Barack Obama and a team of diplomats led by Secretary of State John Kerry. Under that agreement, which the Trump administration abandoned in 2018, Iran shipped most of its nuclear stockpile out of the country, to Russia. The agreement also limited enrichment to under 4 percent. A year after Mr. Trump pulled out of the nuclear accord, Iran began rebuilding the stockpile and inching up the enrichment levels. The new law is clearly designed as a pressure device aimed at removing economic sanctions, which have crippled Iraq\u2019s economy and choked off much of its oil exports. Barring international inspectors, the State Department said Wednesday, would violate Iran\u2019s legal obligations under existing nuclear agreements. \u201cWe have full confidence in the I.A.E.A. to continue carrying out its verification and monitoring activities in Iran, and to report to the board of governors if there is any shortfall in Iran\u2019s cooperation,\u201d the State Department said in an emailed statement. It was not immediately clear how long it would take Iran to reach 20 percent enrichment, but David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, said it could be done in as little as six months. \u201cThey know how to do it,\u201d Mr. Albright said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve done it before. Something less than six months is the worst-case scenario if they devote all their resources to it.\u201d Mr. Rouhani\u2019s top adviser, Hesameddin Ashena, said that the brief window for Mr. Biden to act after taking office could allow the hard-line faction to take credit for lifting sanctions and for getting Washington to re-enter the nuclear deal by threat instead of by diplomacy. But it is far from clear that Iran will be willing to simply go back to the old levels. Some officials have demanded that the United States first pay reparations to Iran for lost oil sales since Mr. Trump reimposed sanctions. Some of Mr. Biden\u2019s aides have said that they could not imagine how that could be politically possible. And while Mr. Biden has said he wants to go back to the deal, he has also said that returning now to the original provisions, which expired in 2030, would be insufficient. The accord would have to be extended and expanded. The Biden transition team declined to comment on the Iranian law. \u201cI think the law is a clear sign that Tehran will not be taking a \u2018wait and see\u2019 attitude toward Biden\u2019s Iran policy,\u201d said Henry Rome, a senior Iran analyst at Eurasia Group. \u201cTehran wants to be at the top of the agenda for the new administration, and escalating its nuclear program is a surefire way to do it.\u201d The concept of expelling inspectors is not a new one. North Korea did the same during a standoff with the Clinton administration in 1994, and also renounced the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, of which it was a member. In 2006 the North exploded its first nuclear device, and it has conducted a half-dozen or so tests since. Iran and North Korea have cooperated extensively on missile technology in the years since, and Iranian officials have carefully studied the North Korean experience. Katie Glueck, William J.

    "article_text": "As Trump Rages, Voters in a Key County Move On: \u2018I\u2019m Not Sweating It\u2019 DOYLESTOWN, Pa. \u2014 Even before the presidential transition was underway, Mike Carr had started to move on with his life. It\u2019s not as though much about American politics had changed in the immediate aftermath of the election, he noted. President Trump was still tweeting baseless conspiracy theories about voter fraud in all caps; cable news panels were still debating the effect the frenzy of accusations would have on democracy. These were the kinds of things that, before the election, would have demanded Mr. Carr\u2019s full attention. For most of the president\u2019s term, Mr. Carr, a 53-year-old real estate lawyer, had been relentlessly attuned to the news cycle and the damage he felt Mr. Trump had done to the country. But ever since Nov. 7, when the election was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Carr has given himself permission to keep the television on mute. \u201cIt\u2019s like a weight has been lifted,\u201d said Mr. Carr, who voted a straight Democratic ticket on Nov. 3, as he did in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice not to be as plugged in.\u201d In Bucks County, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia and one of the state\u2019s most consistently competitive counties down ballot, ardent Biden supporters like Mr. Carr could be forgiven for not unplugging entirely. Their candidate may have won their state by 1.2 percentage points, their county by more than four, but Mr. Trump and his legal team have continued to dispute the results, filing multiple lawsuits, losing multiple lawsuits and parroting unfounded allegations of fraud in the parking lot of a landscaping business not 45 minutes away. By trying to sow distrust in America\u2019s electoral infrastructure and egging on his advisers as they speak openly of a second term, Mr. Trump has confirmed some of his detractors\u2019 worst fears. Yet even in a state at the center of the president\u2019s attacks, in a county where pre-election tensions ran high, many Biden supporters find themselves increasingly comfortable tuning out, moving on and looking forward to January. As in other counties across Pennsylvania and the country, Bucks County has seen a spike in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, with about 64 residents dying from the virus in November, the highest toll since the spring. For many voters here, worries about the virus, coupled with an overwhelming sense of Trump fatigue, have relegated the president to little more than a postelection footnote. Sure, these voters acknowledged, Mr. Trump may still hold the power of the presidency and may, in their estimation, have no qualms about abusing it. But when it comes to the results of the election, they\u2019ve taken to viewing his message as more of a nuisance with a sell-by date than a lasting danger to democracy \u2014 the rantings of a sore loser rather than the opening act of a coup by the leader of the free world. \u201cHe\u2019s just a whiny kid who didn\u2019t get his way. I\u2019m not sweating it,\u201d said Blake Lertzman, 39, while taking a smoke break outside his technology repair shop in the Bucks County seat of Doylestown. \u201cRight now it\u2019s all about the virus. I worry about me and my girlfriend and my community.\u201d As for Mr. Trump\u2019s fervent efforts to overturn the election, \u201cnobody cares,\u201d Mr. Lertzman went on, \u201cunless you\u2019re the kind of person who goes on Newsmax.\u201d Doylestown, which has about 8,300 residents and is over 90 percent white, leans further left than many other boroughs and townships in Bucks County. Nevertheless, many residents take pride in their region as an incubator of centrist politics, citing the county\u2019s record, for instance, of voting for Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 while helping re-elect Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican. Republicans and Democrats alike here recall Mike Fitzpatrick, the moderate Republican congressman who died of brain cancer this year, with fondness. And while many Democrats lament that his brother and successor, Brian Fitzpatrick \u2014 a Republican who represents Pennsylvania\u2019s First District and just won re-election by 13 points \u2014 voted against impeaching Mr. Trump, they will also note unprompted that Mr. Fitzpatrick was recently ranked by the Lugar Center, a nonprofit in Washington, as the most bipartisan member of the House. \u201cWe generally produce candidates in both parties that are pretty moderate,\u201d said Ron Strouse, the mayor of Doylestown, a Democrat who describes himself as a \u201cpractical progressive.\u201d \u201cThe history of ticket-splitting certainly showed this year.\u201d Still, like a number of other self-consciously moderate locales across America, Bucks County was not insulated from the partisan and cultural crosscurrents that defined the presidential election. And as the county seat, Doylestown played host to their suburban Philadelphia iteration. \u201cRallies, counter-rallies, protests, demonstrations \u2014 we\u2019ve had more than 45 since the beginning of this year alone,\u201d Mr. Strouse said. In early September, hundreds gathered in the borough for dueling Black Lives Matter and \u201cBack the Blue\u201d demonstrations, the latter of which included a sea of Trump merchandise and a man reportedly shouting racial slurs and displaying a Nazi salute. In October, as part of a pro-Trump \u201croad rally,\u201d more than 1,000 of the president\u2019s supporters clogged traffic for miles as they converged on Doylestown, where they were met by a counter-demonstration of Biden supporters. Local businesses boarding up in anticipation of summer protests, Trump supporters brandishing Confederate flags as they cruised down Main Street: Doylestown residents recited no shortage of ways their typically placid borough had seemed \u201ctense\u201d in the lead-up to the election. But in the weeks since, even as Mr. Trump has electrified much of his base with his false claims of fraud and his campaign\u2019s harried appeals via text to \u201cchip in $10\u201d to \u201cSTOP THE RADICAL Left from counting any ILLEGAL ballots,\u201d Doylestown has remained at a calm remove. Demonstrations by Trump and Biden supporters alike, once a near-constant presence across town, have ground to a halt. \u201cPeople are more willing to tune out the theater now,\u201d said Anthony Palazzolo, 30, who is a volunteer at the Doylestown Historical Society and a registered Republican who voted for Mr. Biden. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed it in small things, like people are less on their phones and interacting more on the sidewalks. People are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d According to Mr. Palazzolo and others, the growing sang-froid about Mr. Trump\u2019s conspiracy-mongering, even among the area\u2019s most ardent Democrats, is in part a credit to local party leadership, members of which were quick to present a unified front after the county\u2019s votes were tabulated \u2014 offering Bucks County residents a bipartisan show of confidence in their own results even as the president tried to seed doubt and promote division across the state. \u201cOur county had a great election, and that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d said Pat Poprick, the chair of the Bucks County Republican Committee. \u201cI do not think there was any quote-unquote fraud here.\u201d Yet for all their fears of Mr. Trump, many Biden supporters here also expressed confidence that the country\u2019s democratic institutions and traditions were robust enough to withstand the president\u2019s attempts to subvert them \u2014 if only for two more months. Larissa Hopwood, 41, a children\u2019s musician and teacher, was among Mr. Biden\u2019s most vocal supporters in Doylestown, taking the lead in organizing pro-Biden rallies to counteract the steady stream of Trump demonstrations. Ms. Hopwood said the stakes of the presidential election could not have felt higher, particularly because she is the mother of a gender nonconforming child. The day after the election, she attended a \u201cProtect the Results\u201d rally in town. But armed with a confidence that, come Jan. 20, Mr. Biden will be president of the United States, no matter how many lawsuits Mr. Trump files, she has found herself embracing a new sense of lightness, however incrementally. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize it for awhile, but for a week after Biden won, I posted zero Instagrams,\u201d she said. \u201cI think my mind-set was, \u2018Let\u2019s just tune it out: We had our victory.\u2019\u201d Still, despite feeling perhaps a bit less compelled to post and engage daily with political content, she admitted being frustrated by how \u201cpuffy\u201d her social feeds seemed shortly after the election \u2014 posts about lighter topics like, say, \u201cThe Crown,\u201d or People magazine\u2019s \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d cover. But any concerns about complacency among fellow progressives seemed to stem less from concerns over Mr. Trump\u2019s language and actions in this moment, and more from a desire to maintain momentum heading into the Biden era. In other words, Ms. Hopwood said, she\u2019s not terribly worried that a presidential coup is afoot. \u201cThere are government employees in charge of making this transition happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, we are still the United States.\u201d And ultimately, for Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters here, blocking out the president is all the easier when even the neighborhood\u2019s most outspoken Trump supporter seems to have moved on. Daniel Compain, 65, a Cuban-American who fled Fidel Castro\u2019s regime as a child, beamed as he recalled how pedestrians would grimace as they passed the enormous Trump flag he\u2019d hung outside the window of his apartment near Main Street. In an interview at a Starbucks nearby, he maintained that he would not accept the results of the election until the Electoral College officially voted in mid-December. He also had questions, he said, about whether Dominion voting machines had deleted ballots cast for Mr. Trump, echoing false claims made by the president and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. And yet when asked why he had decided to take his Trump flag down, Mr. Compain responded as if the answer were self-evident. \u201cWell, the election is over,\u201d he said.",

    "article_text": "Biden Shows Off a New Accessory: A Walking Boot WILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 The president-elect of the United States clomped across a flag-studded stage on Tuesday, intending to introduce the economic team that, he hopes, will steer the nation through turmoil. In the process, he introduced the country to a less welcome companion: his walking boot. After a slip while playing with one of his dogs, a shelter German shepherd named Major, over the weekend, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., 78, suffered hairline fractures in his right foot, according to Mr. Biden\u2019s office and his doctor. The black boot was a souvenir of the injury poking out over a pant leg of Mr. Biden\u2019s signature navy blue suit. \u201cGood,\u201d Mr. Biden replied to a shouted query about how his foot felt when he arrived at the Queen theater, an event space here near his home. He proceeded to show off the boot to the cameras, quickly lifting his knee to display the contraption. Later, after his team introductions were done and he was walking offstage, Mr. Biden was peppered with more questions about the injury. He flashed a thumbs-up sign to the assembled members of the news media. The health of a president-elect is always an issue of vital national interest, and especially so for Mr. Biden, who at his inauguration will be the oldest president in American history. Although he released health information during the campaign, he was not always forthcoming about his health protocols in the coronavirus era. On the campaign trail, Mr. Biden often laughed off questions about his age \u2014 despite significant reservations, especially during the primary, among some voters \u2014 instructing skeptics to watch him in action as he bounded through parades and onto stages. He also discussed his Peloton workouts and weight routines. In a statement Sunday, Mr. Biden\u2019s doctor, Kevin O\u2019Connor, said the president-elect sustained the fractures in his \u201cmidfoot.\u201d Dr. O\u2019Connor also said Mr. Biden \u201cwill likely require a walking boot for several weeks.\u201d Mr. Biden spent Monday out of the spotlight, meeting virtually with staff and speaking with foreign leaders. But on Tuesday, the boot was visible at times as Mr. Biden stood behind a lectern, introducing his choices for jobs involving the economy and occasionally shifting his weight.  \u201cHe appeared to move without much difficulty, though he did favor the injured foot\u201d as he walked in for his remarks, a reporter covering him for the press pool wrote to the other members of the news media. A Biden spokesman did not respond to more detailed questions about how the injury occurred \u2014 Was Mr. Biden playing catch with his dog? Were they on a walk? \u2014 or about how Mr. Biden was feeling. Mr. Biden, who also has another German shepherd named Champ, has long been a dog owner. Bob Markel, a friend since childhood, said that around 50 years ago Mr. Biden told him that his two dogs at the time were named Governor and Senator. \u201cThese were sizable dogs,\u201d Mr. Markel recalled. \u201cThey were big, just like, apparently, the ones he\u2019s got now, that he\u2019s going to take to the White House.\u201d Former Representative Bob Brady of Pennsylvania, a longtime Biden ally, said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t meet Major, but I met Champ,\u201d describing the pet as \u201cgorgeous.\u201d \u201cHe was probably throwing something around, it could be a toy,\u201d he said, speculating on Mr. Biden\u2019s injury. \u201cI spoke with his guys. He\u2019s fine, he\u2019s fine.\u201d Mr. Biden campaigned on a message of national unity, and Mr. Brady, alluding to reports about future Biden pets, suggested that the president-elect might extend a hand to fans of felines, too. \u201cI heard he\u2019s going to get a cat,\u201d he said.",

    "article_text": "Biden\u2019s Cabinet Picks, Part 2: Antony Blinken What kind of foreign policy is possible for the United States after four years of isolationism under President Trump? Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s pick for secretary of state, has an interventionist streak \u2014 a position influenced by hearing the stories of his stepfather, a holocaust survivor, and by witnessing, when part of the Clinton administration, the consequences of not having intervened earlier to stop the Rwandan genocide. But some vestiges of Trump-era foreign policy will be hard to upend. If confirmed, Mr. Blinken faces the challenge of making the case at home that taking a fuller role abroad is important, while persuading international allies that the United States is back and can be counted on. What course is he likely to steer through that narrow channel? David E. Sanger, a national security correspondent for The New York Times. Mr. Blinken\u2019s extensive foreign policy credentials are expected to help calm American diplomats and global leaders after four years of the Trump administration\u2019s ricocheting strategies and nationalist swaggering. European allies of the United States have welcomed a president who doesn\u2019t see them as rivals. But with the possibility of a Republican-controlled Senate, they are also wary. Mr. Biden wants to reactivate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, but the killing of the top nuclear scientist in the Middle Eastern nation, which Tehran has blamed on Israel, could complicate that aim.

    "article_text": "Mr. Biden, Keep the Pressure on Hong Kong Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, two icons of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement, are going to prison. On Wednesday, Joshua was sentenced to 13.5 months, Agnes to 10 months and a third defendant, Ivan Lam, to seven months, for inciting, organizing or participating in an unlawful assembly at Hong Kong Police Headquarters in June 2019. (They had pleaded guilty.) But they might not get out for quite a bit longer than that: The Chinese government, acting through the Hong Kong authorities, has already pressed more charges. And its point, after all, is to stamp out dissent in Hong Kong. These charges were brought under the Public Order Ordinance, but since June 30 there is also the much more severe national security law. Twelve people who were caught at sea trying to flee Hong Kong in August have been in detention on the mainland since, reportedly with no access to lawyers. Activists like us \u2014 the authors, who are in exile and wanted for arrest or in the diaspora, and our comrades in Hong Kong who face imprisonment or persecution \u2014 will continue to campaign relentlessly against China\u2019s authoritarian expansion and try to safeguard what is left of Hong Kong\u2019s liberal institutions, for as long as we can. But we need the support of governments, businesses, universities, labor rights organizations and NGOs everywhere. If the world does not act resolutely to build a stronger alliance against the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s increasing aggression, more activists will be sacrificed, and more essential democratic values, too. Hong Kong is at the front lines of the resistance against Beijing\u2019s authoritarianism; what happens there should matter to anyone anywhere who cares about the future of freedom, especially since Beijing is trying to export its high-tech, repressive ways to the world. The incoming Biden administration must not only remain critical of the C.C.P. regime but also have the courage to foster a new China policy that prioritizes human rights over other interests. Only then will the United States be able to restore its leadership in a global order committed to freedom, democracy, equality and multilateralism. In June 2019, before Joseph R. Biden Jr. had secured the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination as its presidential candidate, he tweeted: \u201cThe extraordinary bravery shown by hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong, marching for the civil liberties & autonomy promised by China is inspiring. And the world is watching. All of us must stand in support of democratic principles and freedom.\u201d Now that Mr. Biden is president-elect of the United States, we call on him to make good on that sentiment. The C.C.P. government has increasingly been imposing mainland-style authoritarian governance on Hong Kong, in the process scrapping its engagement to Britain under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and sabotaging the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle of governance for Hong Kong, two commitments Beijing undertook that were supposed to ensure a high degree of autonomy for the city until 2047. This summer, the C.C.P. imposed a far-reaching and extremely punitive national security law on the city. That law has since been invoked to arrest protesters, expel even moderate pro-democracy lawmakers from the Legislative Council and discipline teachers deemed to be insufficiently patriotic toward the mainland. Next in line may be the city\u2019s judges, district councilors, civil servants and even school children. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, delivered her annual policy address \u2014 the equivalent of the U.S. president\u2019s State of the Union speech \u2014 last week and said, among other things, that \u201cpositive values\u201d needed to be fostered among students, including \u201ca sense of identity, belonging and responsibility toward the nation, the Chinese race and our society.\u201d Thanks to years of unfair trade practices, the C.C.P. has been able to concentrate wealth and power. More recently, the Chinese government has managed to consolidate its grip by capitalizing on the Covid-19 pandemic: extending the digital surveillance of its citizens in the name of combating the virus or, while other governments struggle with health crises at home, clamping down on the Hong Kong democracy movement and asserting its presence in the South China Sea. This, even though by all serious accounts, the new coronavirus first appeared in China, and more and more reports and investigations \u2014 including a recent CNN analysis of leaked documents from Hubei Province \u2014 show that the Chinese authorities covered up news of the initial outbreak. In the past few years, the Trump administration took various measures to condemn the repression in Hong Kong. It terminated the city\u2019s special trade status; it imposed sanctions on C.C.P. and Hong Kong officials for cracking down on protesters. (Mrs. Lam recently said that she was receiving her government salary in cash, and had \u201cpiles\u201d of it at home, because no bank would give her an account anymore.) Other world leaders, various labor rights organizations and businesses have also begun to re-evaluate their misguided arrangements with China. Many have come to ask whether the allure of short-term financial gains should overshadow the prospect of other kinds of long-term losses. Imposing tariffs on Chinese imports, blacklisting C.C.P.-sponsored companies, investigating C.C.P.-funding at American universities and the activities of the party\u2019s so-called united front, its worldwide network of influence \u2014 all these moves serve the valuable purpose of signaling to China\u2019s leadership that it is violating global rules and that that won\u2019t be tolerated. Yet so far these efforts have not secured any substantial reform from the C.C.P. We hope that the Biden administration will review and reform asylum policies for Hong Kongers and take a close look at sanctions against those who attack the city\u2019s democratic institutions. Critical decisions also need to be made by the new administration about the protection of minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet and strengthening diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Washington must craft a China policy that puts human rights front and center, but without neglecting the urgent need, too, for environmental protection, greater respect for labor rights and fair trade. That would continue to signal strong support not only for human rights activists or proponents of democracy in Hong Kong, but for all people who want to be free.

    "article_text": "Biden\u2019s New Top Economist Has a Longtime Focus on Workers WASHINGTON \u2014 Soon after Cecilia Rouse finished her first stint as a White House economic adviser, in the administration of President Bill Clinton, a prestigious academic journal published what would arguably become her most famous research paper: a study finding sexism in auditions and hiring for symphony orchestras. To complete that study, Ms. Rouse and a co-author, Claudia Goldin of Harvard, conducted years of research. They worked with orchestra managers and unions to unearth records of auditions dating back decades. \u201cWe traveled from city to city,\u201d Ms. Goldin recalled, \u201crummaged through dusty boxes and copied hundreds of entries from yellowing pieces of paper.\u201d The effort reflected both a focus on the forces that hold people back in the economy and a degree of diligence in her research that Ms. Rouse\u2019s colleagues call trademarks of her second stint in the White House, when President Barack Obama tapped her to join his Council of Economic Advisers. And it is what friends and former colleagues say they expect Ms. Rouse to bring to the council if she is confirmed by the Senate to lead it under President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., a job that Mr. Biden said on Tuesday he would restore to cabinet-level status after it was demoted under President Trump. Ms. Rouse, who received her bachelor\u2019s degree and Ph.D. in economics from Harvard, is currently the dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. She emphasized her interest in workers, and what hurts them and holds them back, at an introductory event on Tuesday with Mr. Biden and other nominees for economic posts in his administration. She said her mother, a school psychologist, had encouraged her to take an economics course as a freshman in college, which came during a national spike in unemployment. \u201cIt was impossible to separate what we were learning in the classroom from what I knew was going on in towns across the country,\u201d Ms. Rouse said, \u201cand I found myself drawn to study the labor market in all of its dimensions \u2014 the reasons that jobs disappear, the impact of education on people\u2019s job prospects, the ways we can tear down barriers to job growth and make it easier for people to find long-lasting economic security.\u201d Ms. Rouse will be a pioneer if confirmed \u2014 the first Black chair of the council. And she will take her position during a sagging recovery from a pandemic recession, at a time when millions of Americans have been out of work for months since the virus first surged through the United States. Austan Goolsbee, who led the council under Mr. Obama when Ms. Rouse was a member, said he expected Ms. Rouse to focus on challenges facing workers in the so-called gig economy \u2014 like drivers for ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft \u2014 and on workers who suffer long spells of unemployment in the crisis. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Goolsbee said, \u201cshe was way ahead of everyone on the issues of the long-term unemployed. From the second the thing began, she was saying, we\u2019re going to have to think about the long-term unemployed and how to get them out of unemployment.\u201d Along with her symphony paper \u2014 which found women were substantially more likely to be hired for orchestras when participating in a \u201cblind\u201d audition with their gender concealed \u2014 Ms. Rouse\u2019s research has included work on school performance, educational vouchers and diversity in the economics profession. Ms. Goldin calls her \u201ca leading expert on core labor market issues as well as those in the field of education.\u201d Mr. Goolsbee said he would have not been surprised if Mr. Biden had chosen Ms. Rouse to lead the Education Department, instead of the C.E.A. But at the council, he said, he expected Ms. Rouse to employ a collaborative management style, in the model of another Princeton economist who went to work in government: Ben S. Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chair. In recent months, Ms. Rouse has advocated new federal protections for workers in response to the pandemic. In April she called for a law \u201cthat mandates (and perhaps subsidizes) paid sick leave, which has been shown to reduce turnover, increase productivity and lower overall health care costs for employers.\u201d At her introduction in Delaware, she called the pandemic a \u201cdevastating crisis\u201d but also \u201can opportunity to build a better economy in its wake \u2014 an economy that works for everyone, brings fulfilling job opportunities, and leaves no one to fall through the cracks.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Biden and His Economic Team Urge Quick Action on Stimulus as Risks Mount WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday introduced the economic team he will rely on to help rebuild the U.S. economy at a perilous moment, with coronavirus cases soaring, the Federal Reserve chair warning of challenging months ahead and lawmakers in Congress still struggling to reach agreement on a rescue package. Mr. Biden, speaking in Delaware, called on Congress to pass a substantial relief package to help keep businesses, households and local governments afloat while his Treasury secretary nominee, Janet L. Yellen, called the damage done so far \u201can American tragedy\u201d that could lead to long-term devastation if not quickly corrected. \u201cRight now, the full Congress should come together and pass a robust package for relief to address these urgent needs,\u201d Mr. Biden said. But he acknowledged that any stimulus agreement would necessarily fall far short of the trillions of dollars that Democratic leaders have insisted on for months, saying that \u201cany package passed in a lame-duck session is lucky to be at best just a start.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s nominees made it clear that they were thinking expansively about how to revive the U.S. economy and looking beyond just restoring lost jobs and livelihoods to finding ways to widen economic wealth, broaden opportunities and repair safety net programs. \u201cThis is a moment of urgency and opportunity unlike anything we\u2019ve faced in modern times,\u201d said Cecilia Rouse, Mr. Biden\u2019s nominee to lead the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cThe urgency of ending a devastating crisis. And the opportunity to build a better economy in its wake \u2014 an economy that works for everyone, brings fulfilling job opportunities and leaves no one to fall through the cracks.\u201d But those goals, which were at the center of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, are likely to run into obstacles in Congress, where Republicans, who spent the past four years on a spending spree, have resurrected their concerns about the federal deficit. They have cited it as a reason to forgo the kind of large stimulus package that Mr. Biden and other top Democrats have said is needed. The political divisions were on display Tuesday, as a bipartisan group of centrist senators announced in the morning that they were working on a $908 billion compromise stimulus package. By the afternoon, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, announced that he had been discussing his own proposal with Trump administration officials and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader. That package would be hundreds of billions of dollars smaller than the bipartisan plan \u2014 and thus a nonstarter with Democrats. But Mr. McConnell seemed to suggest that President Trump would not sign a more expansive bill, reminding Republicans in a private conference call and reporters during a news conference that a presidential signature is needed. The continued likelihood of congressional gridlock before Inauguration Day threatens to saddle Mr. Biden\u2019s economic team with dim prospects come Jan. 21, when it will confront an economy that has seen a slowdown in hiring growth, manufacturing activity and other key measures in recent weeks. Millions of Americans are set to lose unemployment assistance at year\u2019s end. Others could face eviction and foreclosure as government moratoriums expire. \u201cThe pace of improvement has moderated,\u201d the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, saying the rise in virus cases was \u201cconcerning and could prove challenging in the next few months.\u201d \u201cThe risk of overdoing it is less than the risk of underdoing it,\u201d Mr. Powell said. Administration officials have shown little sign of worry about recent economic developments, insisting the recovery is on track while Mr. Trump continues his legal quest to overturn his re-election defeat at the polls. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, appearing alongside Mr. Powell, downplayed the broader risks facing the economy and blamed economic shutdowns in some states for slowing progress. While he called for targeted relief for sectors that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, like restaurants and airlines, he said the economy had recovered faster than many had expected and that the economy had \u201cregained 58 percent of the lost jobs.\u201d He defended his decision to end several of the Fed\u2019s emergency lending programs on Dec. 31. He has also requested that the central bank return the Treasury funds supporting those programs. Democrats said the moves amounted to economic sabotage. \u201cEither you\u2019re purposefully trying to stop President-elect Biden and Janet Yellen from getting to work for the people we all serve, or you\u2019re so delusional that you think because the stock market is back up, everything is fine,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. \u201cEither way, it\u2019s malpractice.\u201d Mr. Powell, who told lawmakers that the Fed would have preferred to keep those lending programs going while acknowledging that it was Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s place to decide, painted a more dire picture of the economic outlook. He pointed to continued uncertainty around the speed of a vaccine rollout, the reality that millions remain out of work and the fact that small businesses could fail in the winter months. \u201cWe do have a long way to go,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cWe\u2019ll use our tools until the danger is well and truly past, and it may require help from other parts of government as well, including Congress.\u201d Republicans insist that the economy is recovering and that the United States does not need to borrow more money for another big relief package, while Democrats insist that a large jolt of stimulus is necessary and that now is not the time to worry about deficits. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason states and localities have to have a balanced budget but we\u2019re allowed to have a deficit to deal with crises and emergencies as we have in the past,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cWe have to keep vital public services running, have to give aid to local and state governments to make sure they can have law enforcement officers, firefighters and educators as we did in 2009.\u201d After months of deadlock on Capitol Hill, a bipartisan group of senators tried to move things forward with the $908 billion compromise stimulus proposal, funded in part by repurposing the money that Mr. Mnuchin clawed back from the Fed lending programs. The proposal, spearheaded by two centrists \u2014 Senators Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine \u2014 and a handful of senators from both parties, has not been publicly endorsed by either Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California or Mr. McConnell. Intended as a stopgap measure to last until March, it would restore federal unemployment benefits that lapsed over the summer, but at half the rate, providing $300 a week for 18 weeks, and does not include another round of checks for every American. The measure would provide $160 billion to help state, local and tribal governments facing fiscal ruin \u2014 a fraction of what Democrats had sought. Also included was $288 billion to help small businesses, restaurants and theaters, and a short-term federal liability shield from coronavirus-related lawsuits. In contrast, the framework circulated on Capitol Hill by top Republicans does not include funds for state and local governments and curtails a short restoration of federal unemployment benefits even further. \u201cThe advantage of our compromise bill is it has bipartisan, bicameral support,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cI want a bill that can become law.\u201d The bipartisan plan is an attempt to find a middle ground between the dueling stimulus proposals that Democrats and Republicans have haggled over for months. Its cost is less than half of what Democratic leaders had pushed for in the weeks leading up to the election but nearly double the latest proposal from Republican leaders. It includes most of the main ingredients that Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders have called critical for a deal, a possible sign that it could form a basis for a compromise that Mr. Biden could get behind. Asked about the plan by reporters after his event with his economic team, Mr. Biden replied: \u201cI just heard about it. I\u2019ll take a look at it when I get back.\u201d The fresh attempt at a bipartisan compromise came as Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin held their first phone discussion since late October, when they had a flurry of pre-election conversations that failed to culminate in a deal. Ms. Pelosi said she and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, had sent a new proposal of their own to Republican leaders on Monday. John Lettieri, the president of the Economic Innovation Group think tank in Washington, which has pushed for more small-business aid, said the bipartisan plan \u201cseems close to being the sweet spot\u201d for a possible compromise \u2014 if one is possible. Some Senate Republicans on Tuesday reiterated opposition to any deal that sends money to support state and local government budgets, with Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana challenging Mr. Powell at the hearing about whether states are really in such bad straits and suggesting the money would be used to shore up shaky pension funds. \u201cI\u2019ve always said, I think it\u2019s an area that\u2019s worth looking,\u201d Mr. Powell said, noting that states are among the largest employers in the economy and that they provide critical services. Mr. Biden\u2019s appointees all sounded an urgent tone as the incoming administration faces the prospect of a double-dip recession. His nominees, all of whom must win Senate confirmation, talked about the pain of the pandemic recession, noting that it was falling hardest on traditionally marginalized Americans and widening the divide between the rich and the poor. Ms. Yellen, a former Fed chair and an academic labor economist, said she had gone into economics \u201cbecause I was concerned about the toll of unemployment on people, families and communities.\u201d She warned that inaction in the face of the current economic crisis \u201cwill produce a self-reinforcing downturn causing yet more devastation.\u201d Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.",

    "article_text": "Republican Resistance to Tanden Illustrates Trouble Ahead for Biden WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The fierce and pre-emptive Republican pushback against President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s choice of Neera Tanden this week to head the White House budget office underscored the difficulties the incoming administration will face in maneuvering its nominees through a polarized Senate. In the 11 years since Mr. Biden served in the chamber, partisanship has intensified, and nominations \u2014 once an area dominated by courtesy, comity and a presumption of accommodation \u2014 have become just another brutal battlefield. Republicans will not be eager to accede to Mr. Biden\u2019s choices if they can find reason for opposition. And disparaging comments about Republicans on Twitter from Ms. Tanden, a longtime Democratic policy adviser and head of a liberal think tank, were enough for many Republicans to threaten the nomination well before it was made official on Tuesday. \u201cTrumpism has infected the entire Republican caucus,\u201d said James P. Manley, a former longtime top Senate Democratic aide, who urged the incoming administration to brace for intense opposition from Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \u201cI am not sure everyone has figured out yet what is going on here, but I hope they will soon, and prepare for what is coming.\u201d Should Democrats win two Senate seats in runoff elections to be held on Jan. 5 in Georgia, the party would control the agenda and make approval of Mr. Biden\u2019s nominees much easier. But if Democrats fail, Republicans will have the power to decide the fate of Mr. Biden\u2019s executive and judicial branch picks. The reality of a Democratic White House and a Republican Senate will take some adjusting to on Capitol Hill after four years of Republicans working hand-in-hand with President Trump on nominations. Republicans said they were stunned by the selection of Ms. Tanden, whom many knew mainly as a hostile social media presence, to head the Office of Management and Budget. Even though many Republicans have refused to recognize Mr. Biden as the winner of the election, they said they were surprised that his team had not checked in with them on how they might react to her nomination to an agency that lawmakers in both parties see as critical when it comes to advancing congressional priorities. \u201cThat was just an unforced error,\u201d Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said on Tuesday. He said that moving forward in future cases without weighing Republican sentiment was \u201ca roll of the dice\u201d that could cause unnecessary embarrassment to a nominee or to Mr. Biden\u2019s White House. Initially, Republicans \u2014 who had refused to hold hearings for President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee in 2016 \u2014 suggested that they might not even take up Ms. Tanden\u2019s nomination were it sent to the Senate. But Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who is poised to be the top Republican on one of the two committees that would oversee hearings for Ms. Tanden, said he believed she should receive one even if he was skeptical about her chances of confirmation. \u201cThat\u2019s our responsibility,\u201d said Mr. Portman, who oversaw the budget office under President George W. Bush. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll get the votes.\u201d The handling of the announcement of Ms. Tanden\u2019s nomination left some in both parties wondering whether Mr. Biden\u2019s team was misreading the environment on Capitol Hill, where voting against an administration\u2019s nominees has become essentially the default position for senators in the party out of power in recent years. But people close to the transition team said opposition to Ms. Tanden\u2019s nomination from some Republicans was no surprise to the president-elect or his team, nor was it evidence that Mr. Biden, who served almost four decades in the Senate, was na\u00efve about what it would take to win confirmation of his choices. One person familiar with the deliberations said they expected as much from Republicans already angling to run for president in four years. Advisers said Mr. Biden was cleareyed about the need to use some of his political capital to fight for Ms. Tanden\u2019s nomination, citing her years of policymaking experience and a compelling personal story as reasons to fight to get her confirmed. They noted that the reaction from Republicans to Mr. Biden\u2019s other nominees has been more muted, with some Republicans suggesting they would be willing to give the president-elect deference in terms of who he wants in his cabinet. One person close to the nomination process said that Mr. Biden and his team had, in fact, been reaching out to Republican lawmakers in recent weeks. Transition officials said the crisis situation in the nation makes quick confirmation imperative. \u201cThe country is facing multiple crises, from a pandemic that is killing over 10,000 Americans a week to a recession that is continuing to push thousands out of the work force,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a transition spokesman. \u201cThe American people cannot afford partisan obstruction of qualified and experienced women who are nominees.\u201d Democrats scoffed at the criticisms surrounding Ms. Tanden\u2019s selection, particularly over her Twitter feed \u2014 given that most Senate Republicans have diligently spent four years evading queries about the array of policy announcements, racist commentary and inflammatory attacks on their own colleagues from Mr. Trump on Twitter. \u201cAfter spending four years pretending that they didn\u2019t see the latest insane tweet from President Trump, Senate Republicans seem to have found a newfound interest in the Twitter feeds of President-elect Biden\u2019s cabinet selection,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on the Senate floor. \u201cA few critical tweets about substantive policy positions have caused Senate Republicans to label Ms. Tanden\u2019s nomination \u2018radioactive.\u2019 Spare us the hyperbole.\u201d Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said he believed that Mr. Biden and his team should reach out to Capitol Hill about the looming nominations. He added that he had been in touch with some of the intended nominees about scheduling private, one-on-one meetings. (On Tuesday, Mr. Schumer\u2019s office circulated photographs of him in a video conference with Mr. Biden\u2019s choices for secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, and director of national intelligence, Avril D. Haines.) \u201cThat\u2019s probably the most important first thing because there\u2019s nothing like making your case for yourself,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. \u201cFour years ago, President Trump put some nominees up \u2014 if they said things in tweets or whatever that we didn\u2019t like, we\u2019d ask them tough questions about that, so she will expect the same.\u201d Democrats also said they were astounded by calls from Republicans for extensive disclosures of business dealings from Mr. Biden\u2019s potential picks after the record compiled by Mr. Trump. \u201cThis is just stunning, even by the double standards of Washington,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who labeled the Trump administration \u201cthe Babe Ruth of darkness.\u201d \u201cThe Trump administration has stonewalled on so many things \u2014 starting with the president\u2019s taxes \u2014 and then they come in and the first thing they\u2019re doing is saying, \u2018Oh, my goodness, there\u2019s no transparency in the Biden administration,\u2019\u201d he added. Mr. Manley, the former Senate aide, urged Democrats to stand behind the new administration\u2019s nominees or face an onslaught of obstruction from emboldened Republicans. \u201cIf Republicans have objections to her policy views, they should give her a hearing and grill her,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the idea that they are prepared to block her nomination because she was mean to them on Twitter is ridiculous, and no Democrat should fall for it.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Four Women Who Will Handle the Media in the Biden White House WASHINGTON \u2014 In one of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s closing campaign advertisements, he promised a \u201cnew world coming\u201d if Americans voted for \u201chonor,\u201d \u201cdecency,\u201d \u201crespect of office\u201d and \u201ctruth.\u201d The restoration of \u201ctruth\u201d was illustrated in the ad by a photograph of the podium in the White House briefing room, which under President Trump has been used to disseminate falsehoods and to undermine the credibility of a news media that his aides have referred to as the \u201copposition party.\u201d The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, for instance, recently refused to take a question from a CNN correspondent, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t call on activists.\u201d It was in the briefing room that Mr. Trump suggested that an \u201cinjection inside\u201d the human body with a disinfectant like bleach or isopropyl alcohol could help combat the coronavirus; and where his first press secretary, Sean Spicer, set the tone for the administration when he falsely claimed that the president\u2019s inauguration crowd was the \u201clargest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\u201d The relationship between a White House press office seeking to portray the president and his decisions in the best light possible and the news media seeking to separate fact from spin is designed to be adversarial. But Mr. Biden is entering office with the stated intent of restoring credibility to government \u2014 and to the briefing room. His advisers have said that the communications team will endeavor for a return to pre-Trump \u201cnormalcy.\u201d And that seemed to be reflected in the communications team he announced this week. \u2014 Annie Karni Mr. Biden\u2019s choice of Jennifer Psaki, 42, a veteran of the Obama administration who is generally viewed by reporters as fair and accessible, as his chief spokeswoman embodies that return to normalcy approach. Ms. Psaki, a former White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman, did not work on the Biden campaign. But she was brought in by two top Biden advisers, Jeffrey D. Zients and Anita Dunn, to help with the transition. Mr. Biden\u2019s decision to appoint Ms. Psaki as press secretary, a role in which she will become one of the most recognizable faces of the new administration, came together in a rush of meetings over the past 10 days. Mr. Biden, officials said, was particularly drawn to Ms. Psaki by her background at the State Department. There, she worked under Secretary of State John Kerry and grew comfortable delivering 90-minute briefings on foreign policy issues, like a dispute over the South China Sea. At the White House, Ms. Psaki intends to bring back the daily press briefing, which has been all but phased out over the past four years. It is not clear, however, when those sessions might resume, given the constraints of the pandemic. But as the incoming administration prepares to roll out a coronavirus vaccine and convince more than 300 million Americans that it is safe, Ms. Psaki, colleagues said, views a central part of her job as restoring faith in the words spoken from behind the podium. \u201cThe clown games are over,\u201d said Susan Rice, who was President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser. \u201cJen will represent the professionalism and decency and commitment to transparency that has been a hallmark of Joe Biden\u2019s career.\u201d As Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Ms. McEnany has focused on remaining in the president\u2019s inner circle and has made little effort to be accessible to reporters or to disseminate accurate information. Ms. Psaki plans to take a different approach, Biden transition officials said. At the State Department, they noted, Ms. Psaki moved the spokesperson\u2019s office, which had been on the sixth floor, where it was inaccessible to reporters, to be next to the press room. Ms. Psaki, pronounced SOCK-ee, was a candidate for the press secretary\u2019s job under Mr. Obama, but she is arguably coming into it now at a more difficult and more critical moment. \u201cI think she brings as much experience in that building, as much as anyone has ever brought to the job,\u201d said Robert Gibbs, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s first White House press secretary. \u201cThe world this administration inherits has more challenges than any in nearly a century. Having a steady, experienced voice behind that podium will serve them well.\u201d Since leaving government, Ms. Psaki has worked as a senior vice president and managing director for the Washington office of Global Strategy Group, a public relations firm that works with corporate, nonprofit and political clients, and has served a principal at WestExec Advisors, a consulting firm founded by Antony J. Blinken, Mr. Biden\u2019s choice for secretary of state. Ms. Psaki, a graduate of the College of William and Mary, was most recently a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank, and a paid contributor on CNN, a position she left in September. She is expected to have access to Mr. Biden, whom she has known for 12 years. \u201cThe name of the game is access,\u201d Mr. Gibbs said. \u201cAre you in the meetings? Some of the best prep for the briefing itself was being in the meeting \u2014 understanding where the president\u2019s head was and where the debate was going.\u201d \u2014 Annie Karni Kate Bedingfield has spent the past two years as one of the most visible public faces of the Biden campaign. As communications director, she will help shape the message for the president and the White House. Mr. Biden is known for turning to loyal advisers, and Ms. Bedingfield has been a trusted aide since 2015, when she joined the vice president\u2019s staff as communications director as he was weighing whether to run for president in 2016. She was an original member of his 2020 campaign, serving as a deputy campaign manager and communications director. In that role, she often appeared on television as a surrogate for Mr. Biden, sometimes from her bedroom because of the pandemic. With Ms. Bedingfield running the communications operation, the campaign\u2019s message of unifying the country remained consistent from Day 1 through Election Day, even amid criticism and second-guessing from some Democrats. During the campaign, she was forced to navigate a number of public relations challenges, including the attacks from Mr. Trump and his allies on Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden and his business dealings in Ukraine. Ms. Bedingfield and her team did not hesitate to press reporters on the word choices they made in describing the baseless accusations against Mr. Biden and his son. Ms. Bedingfield was also charged with trying to make a positive case for Mr. Biden after he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary, low points on the Biden campaign that at the time raised serious doubts about his path to the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cThe job she did in the campaign is underappreciated,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who served as White House communications director for Mr. Obama. \u201cWhen a candidate comes in with the expectations and experience of Joe Biden and then falls so dramatically as he did, where he came in fourth and fifth, to hold a campaign together and keep the candidate focused and upbeat and optimistic is a very difficult task.\u201d Ms. Bedingfield, 39, who grew up in the Atlanta area and is a graduate of the University of Virginia, worked on John Edwards\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign and in the Obama White House during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term. She later worked as vice president of corporate communications for the Motion Picture Association of America and as vice president of communications for Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the N.B.A.\u2019s Washington Wizards, the N.H.L.\u2019s Washington Capitals and the W.N.B.A.\u2019s Washington Mystics. \u2014 Thomas Kaplan  The president-elect is an institutionalist, a deal-making centrist and a consummate political insider who has hired a number of top advisers with backgrounds rooted in the traditional corridors of Washington power. One of his newly selected press aides brings a notably different perspective to the team. Karine Jean-Pierre, who was named Mr. Biden\u2019s principal deputy press secretary, has held a number of governmental and campaign roles. But she is steeped in grass-roots progressive activism, too, as a former chief public affairs officer at the liberal group MoveOn. She is also a former political analyst for NBC and MSNBC. Ms. Jean-Pierre has also spoken about her belief that her identity as a woman of color and daughter of Haitian immigrants cut a sharp contrast with the divisive and at times racist rhetoric promoted by Mr. Trump. \u201cI am everything that Donald Trump hates,\u201d she said in a video she filmed for MoveOn. \u201cI\u2019m a Black woman, I\u2019m gay, I am a mom. Both my parents were born in Haiti.\u201d Ms. Jean-Pierre, 46, served in the Obama White House and worked on Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 campaigns. She was also a deputy campaign manager for the unsuccessful presidential campaign of Martin O\u2019Malley, a former governor of Maryland, in 2016. But she was not an original member of the Biden campaign, arriving as a senior adviser last spring after Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon was brought on as campaign manager. Ms. Jean-Pierre later served as the chief of staff for Mr. Biden\u2019s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris. That job gave Ms. Jean-Pierre access to the candidate but did not require her to engage in the daily sparring with journalists that she may need to do in her new role, in which she is expected to work closely with Ms. Psaki. Ms. Jean-Pierre, a graduate of the New York Institute of Technology and Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs, came up in New York politics, describing former Mayor David N. Dinkins, who recently died, as a mentor.  \u201cShe will bring a steadiness, an evenness,\u201d said Leah Daughtry, a veteran Democratic strategist who knows Ms. Jean-Pierre from New York. \u201cShe also brings her own experience as the daughter of immigrants, as someone from the queer community, as someone who\u2019s a New Yorker.\u201d \u2014 Katie Glueck and Thomas Kaplan As Mr. Biden reveled in his Super Tuesday victories in March in a speech in California, two protesters threatened to ruin the moment, climbing onstage with the septuagenarian candidate. Symone D. Sanders did not waste any time. She charged forward and, with the help of Mr. Biden\u2019s wife, Jill Biden, and several aides, hauled one of the protesters away. Ms. Sanders is no stranger to brawling on behalf of her boss. She served as an outspoken senior adviser to Mr. Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, emerging as a prolific surrogate at news conferences and on social media. Now, she will be a senior adviser and chief spokeswoman for Ms. Harris, whom she advised during the general election, traveling with her and assisting with debate preparations. Ms. Sanders is expected to play key roles both in guiding the press operation and in advising as Ms. Harris pursues her own initiatives as vice president. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be able to work both worlds very, very well,\u201d said Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and an incoming senior adviser to Mr. Biden in the White House. Ms. Sanders, 30, a Nebraska native, is fluent in both the language of the left and internet discourse \u2014 in contrast to some of Mr. Biden\u2019s longer-serving advisers \u2014 and she was an important point of contact for several key political constituencies during the race. But she does not have the decades of traditional campaign and Washington experience that many in Mr. Biden\u2019s orbit value. Indeed, she signed on with the Biden campaign after working as press secretary for Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign at age 25. Yet a combination of loyalty to Mr. Biden and a different perspective from many in his inner circle helped Ms. Sanders become an important and respected voice in the campaign, and she was mentioned as a possible White House press secretary. In the vice president\u2019s office, Ms. Sanders will work closely with Ashley Etienne, the communications director for Ms. Harris who is a veteran of the Obama administration and also served as a top aide to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. This year, Ms. Sanders, a graduate of Creighton University, published a book titled, \u201cNo, You Shut Up: Speaking Truth to Power and Reclaiming America.\u201d She has also done strategic communications consulting work, but does not intend to continue that while in government. In an interview, Ms. Sanders, who is Black, noted that the transition had rolled out at one time the White House communications team\u2019s leadership, made up entirely of women \u2014 both white women and women of color. \u201cThe most qualified people for the job also happen to all be women,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is historic. Not too long ago, the powers that be would not have picked us.\u201d \u2014 Katie Glueck",

    "article_text": "Mark Walker jumps into North Carolina Senate race, hoping to ward off Lara Trump and other potential rivals. WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Mark Walker announced on Tuesday that he would run for North Carolina\u2019s open Senate seat in 2022, kicking off what is likely to be a fierce Republican primary that could pit him against President Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law in a key swing state. In an interview, Mr. Walker, a former Baptist pastor from Greensboro, sought to frame himself as a \u201cbridge builder\u201d between Republicans and groups that the party had struggled to reach in recent years, particularly Black voters. \u201cI am trying to make the case you might want to select somebody who has the ability, or the history to work with people from all different communities,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a track record of going to places and accomplishing things that Republicans have not been able to do.\u201d Mr. Walker, 51, announced last year that he would not seek re-election after a court ordered North Carolina to redraw its congressional map, making his district much more Democratic. He had been mulling a Senate run for months after Senator Richard M. Burr, a fellow Republican, decided to retire. By entering the race just days after North Carolina certified its November elections, Mr. Walker was aiming to potentially box out other Republicans contemplating getting into the race. Other Republicans who are eyeing Mr. Burr\u2019s seat include Lara Trump, the wife of the president\u2019s son Eric Trump; Pat McCrory, the former governor; Representative George Holding, who is also retiring; and Dan Forest, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor who ran an unsuccessful campaign for governor this year. Ms. Trump has told associates that she is considering entering the contest, and her campaign could be a test of the family\u2019s political staying power once Mr. Trump leaves the White House. Despite stylistic differences, Mr. Walker has been a close ally of Mr. Trump in the House and would welcome his support in the Senate contest. Still, he offered a subtle dig on Tuesday at the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, who resides in Westchester County but has North Carolina roots. \u201cIf somebody wants to move to the state, legally they can do that, but it doesn\u2019t deter me,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cI have nothing to say but good things about their family.\u201d At least one potential contender has already passed on the race. Mark Meadows, another North Carolina conservative and Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, said last month he would not run for the seat as some expected. Democrats see the seat as one of their best pickup opportunities in 2022. Erica D. Smith, a state senator has already indicated she will run again, after losing the Democratic primary this year to Cal Cunningham, who fell short in his bid to unseat Senator Thom Tillis. Other possible candidates include Josh Stein, the state\u2019s attorney general, and Jeff Jackson, another state senator.",

    "article_text": "Biden Faces a Balancing Act in Choosing Top Aides With Business Ties WASHINGTON \u2014 Five years ago, Jeffrey D. Zients was the head of the Obama administration\u2019s National Economic Council, working to push across the finish line a federal rule that would prevent financial advisers from taking advantage of retirees. He won praise from progressives for fending off fierce resistance from Wall Street and for fighting for consumer protections. These days, Mr. Zients is a co-chairman of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s transition team who is being watched warily by members of the Democratic Party\u2019s left wing. Progressive advocacy groups such as the Revolving Door Project and Justice Democrats, concerned that he would defend corporate America if given a top economic policy job in the Biden administration, pushed to keep him out of such a role. They view his recent work running an investment fund \u2014 Cranemere \u2014 and sitting on the board of Facebook as a detriment. The pre-emptive resistance to Mr. Zients (pronounced ZYE-ents) from the left is the latest indication of how the Democratic Party has shifted in the dozen years since former President Barack Obama took office amid the financial crisis. Now, business and finance experience can turn otherwise qualified White House candidates into pariahs for progressives. Mr. Zients, 54, has emerged as an important power center in the Biden transition team and was mentioned as a possible candidate to once again lead the National Economic Council or head the Office of Management and Budget, a role he held in an acting capacity during the Obama administration. With those jobs set to be filled by others, Mr. Zients is the front-runner, according to people familiar with the transition team\u2019s plans, to be the Biden administration\u2019s Covid czar, steering the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. In a sign of the pushback to come, the Revolving Door Project, which has been urging Mr. Biden to keep corporate influence out of his administration, has compiled a 13-page document about Mr. Zients. The file highlights his wealth, his appetite for deficit reduction during the Obama years and his recent work as chief executive of Cranemere. In the Obama administration, \u201chis role was essentially to be a management consultant for the executive branch: cutting costs, finding efficiencies and looking at things like a businessman,\u201d the Revolving Door document says. The group points to the majority stake that Cranemere took in NorthStar Anesthesia, a company that provides anesthesia services to hospitals and medical offices, in 2018. It cites negative reviews that NorthStar Anesthesia received through the Better Business Bureau, including allegations of surprise billing and a threat to send a dental patient\u2019s bill to a collection agency during a dispute over insurance coverage. That matter was resolved, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. A spokeswoman for NorthStar said that within two months of Cranemere\u2019s acquisition of the company, it had ended its practice of \u201cbalance billing\u201d \u2014 charging patients the difference between the cost of their services and what their insurers will pay. Jennifer Psaki, a spokeswoman for the Biden transition team, said Mr. Zients opposes surprise billing practices. \u201cJeff, like President-elect Biden, supports legislation to stop surprise billing by forcing the entire health care system to limit patient payments to in-network rates for all procedures and providers not preapproved by the patient,\u201d Ms. Psaki said. Progressives have been pushing the Biden transition team to install their preferred candidates in top roles and have been fairly supportive of some of Mr. Biden\u2019s early picks. These include Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, to be Treasury secretary; Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton University labor economist, to run the Council of Economic Advisers; and Neera Tanden, the chief executive of the Center for American Progress, to lead the Office of Management and Budget. But others are triggering a backlash, including Brian Deese, whom Mr. Biden has tapped to head the National Economic Council, and Adewale Adeyemo, the president-elect\u2019s choice for deputy Treasury secretary. Both men have worked at the asset management firm BlackRock, and many in the progressive wing view deep industry ties as a red flag. \u201cDemocrats should over all be alarmed by any Democratic administration considering filling the White House with Wall Street insiders and corporate lobbyists,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, spokesman for Justice Democrats, a political action committee. Early in his career, Mr. Zients worked as a consultant at Bain & Company before joining the Advisory Board Company, a health care research and consulting firm, where he rose to chief executive. He helped lead a spinoff of that business, which became the Corporate Executive Board, and both companies ultimately went public, in 1999 and 2001. According to Fortune, the Advisory Board\u2019s profitable initial public offering helped fuel Mr. Zients\u2019s net worth, which the magazine placed at nearly $150 million by 2002. In 2009, Mr. Zients joined the Office of Management and Budget as \u201cchief performance officer,\u201d rising to prominence within the Obama administration as a \u201cMr. Fix-It\u201d with strong operations skills and a knack for solving tough problems. Obama administration officials remember him for reviving the Affordable Care Act\u2019s website, HealthCare.gov, after glitches plagued its rollout. \u201cI call him the ultimate firefighter on these jobs,\u201d said Denis R. McDonough, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief of staff, who asked Mr. Zients to take on the project of fixing the website in 2013. \u201cHe runs into the burning buildings. He doesn\u2019t ask why. He doesn\u2019t ask when. He doesn\u2019t ask who\u2019s going with him.\u201d Later in Mr. Obama\u2019s second term, Mr. Zients led the National Economic Council, where he shepherded new regulations to crack down on payday lending and steered the development of the so-called fiduciary rule \u2014 a requirement that financial professionals put the interests of their customers with retirement accounts ahead of their own. The Labor Department rule, which the financial services and insurance industries strongly challenged, was struck down by a federal appeals court in 2018. Those efforts earned him accolades from some progressive Democrats. \u201cThe government needs talent and experience,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, the president of Better Markets, which promotes Wall Street reform, and a member of Mr. Biden\u2019s transition review team for the Fed, banking and securities regulators. \u201cPeople who are going to try to regulate an industry as complicated as finance can\u2019t say we\u2019re only going to hire people who know nothing about finance.\u201d But his role as a bridge to business during the Obama administration has raised some eyebrows. Mr. Zients was one of the administration\u2019s chief liaisons to executives and lobbyists when anger at Wall Street over the 2007-8 financial crisis was still at its peak. Top lobbyists such as the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have praised Mr. Zients as someone who heard them out. Describing his desire to listen to business leaders, Mr. Zients told executives at a 2014 event at the Economic Club of Washington, \u201cYou are the customers, all of you as business leaders, in terms of growing the economy.\u201d After Mr. Obama left office, Mr. Zients joined the private equity investor Vincent Mai\u2019s Cranemere fund as chief executive. The private holding company has investors from United States, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East and takes a long-term investing approach in the mold of Warren E. Buffett. Mr. Zients, who is on leave from Cranemere, also spent two years on the board of Facebook and was a member of the company\u2019s audit committee. He has told people that he had concerns about the company\u2019s direction and governance, and opted not to seek re-election to the board this year. Facebook has come under fire from Democrats for allowing the spread of disinformation and from Republicans who accuse it of censorship. Jeff Hauser, the director of the Revolving Door Project, said Mr. Zients\u2019s experience working in private equity and at Facebook was particularly problematic and could portend trouble for progressive causes in a Biden White House. And while he sees Mr. Zients\u2019s experience in the health care industry as useful for managing the pandemic response, Mr. Hauser said he was concerned that Mr. Zients could be too accommodating to business as vaccines are rolled out next year. \u201cDissemination and delivery of the vaccine will be a significant undertaking,\u201d Mr. Hauser said. He added that Mr. Zients understood how to do it, \u201cbut whether or not he would be too sympathetic to businesses in management of that power is to be determined.\u201d In a role directing the virus response, which will require coordination across government agencies and the private sector, corporate management experience could be an asset. Fred P. Hochberg, who was president of the U.S. Export-Import Bank from 2009-17, said that ideological labels evolved over time and that business experience should not be a blemish. \u201cI think Jeff is certainly progressive, but there\u2019s a pragmatism, a \u2018what can we get done to move things forward?\u2019\u201d Mr. Hochberg said. \u201cIn government, it\u2019s about accomplishing things. It\u2019s not just about making a statement.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Biden introduces his economic team at a moment of big risks. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. introduced key members of his economic team on Tuesday, as he prepares to assume the White House at a moment when the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is slowing and millions remain out of work. Mr. Biden, speaking at an event in Delaware, said he was building \u201ca first-rate team that\u2019s going to get us through this ongoing economic crisis.\u201d The president-elect called on Congress to pass a \u201crobust\u201d rescue package to help households, businesses and state and local governments, saying many communities are \u201cteetering on the edge.\u201d Mr. Biden is poised to enter the White House at a time of national crisis amid the worsening virus outbreak. The Department of Labor and Department of Commerce have reported an increase in applications for state jobless benefits and a decrease in personal income. Coronavirus cases have soared in recent weeks, a development that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell called \u201cconcerning\u201d in testimony before lawmakers on Tuesday, saying it \u201ccould prove challenging in the next few months.\u201d In a sign of how critical a role economic policy will play in the Biden administration, the President-elect said he was returning the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers to a cabinet-level position. President Trump had demoted the C.E.A. chair during his administration. Mr. Biden has chosen Cecilia Rouse to lead the Council of Economic Advisers; she would be the first Black woman in the role. Ms. Rouse is a Princeton economist who worked on the Council of Economic Advisers during part of the Obama era and on the White House\u2019s National Economic Council during the Clinton administration. Mr. Biden has warned of a \u201cvery dark winter\u201d ahead and called on Congress to pass relief to help workers, businesses, and state and local governments. Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers are preparing for what could be another economic downturn in early 2021. But another economic stimulus package has languished in Congress, where Democrats and Republicans have been unable to reach a deal, though leaders of both parties have called for compromise in recent days. A bipartisan group of senators rolled out a potential compromise plan on Tuesday morning that appeared to fit the contours of what Mr. Biden, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, have said must frame any stimulus deal in Washington. They include additional aid to the unemployed and small businesses, along with money to help state and local governments patch budget holes that have been ripped open during the pandemic. Tuesday\u2019s slate of nominees and appointees includes several women in top economic roles. The selections, markedly different from Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, which has been overwhelmingly white and male, follow Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign promise to build an administration that looks like America. His pick for the Office of Management and Budget \u2014 Neera Tanden, the chief executive of the Center for American Progress \u2014 would be the first Indian-American to lead the office if confirmed. Mr. Biden also selected Janet L. Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, to be his Treasury Secretary. If confirmed, she would be the first woman to fill the position. Ms. Tanden has met immediate resistance from Republican senators who have criticized her for attacking Republicans publicly, including on her Twitter feed. She previewed the group\u2019s likely emphasis on personal stories in a Twitter post on Monday, after her nomination was announced: \u201cAfter my parents were divorced when I was young, my mother relied on public food and housing programs to get by,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow, I\u2019m being nominated to help ensure those programs are secure, and ensure families like mine can live with dignity.\u201d Mr. Biden also announced his picks for deputy treasury secretary, Adewale Adeyemo, and members of the Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey. Mr. Adeyemo served as a senior international economic adviser under former President Barack Obama, and Mr. Bernstein was Mr. Biden\u2019s first chief economist when he was vice president. Ms. Boushey, a top policy adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2016, leads the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank focused on inequality. The introductions follow a similar event last week, when Mr. Biden publicly introduced members of his foreign policy and national security team.",

    "article_text": "As uncertainty grows, Congress kick-starts stimulus talks. The country\u2019s economy, like the nation\u2019s politics, is queasily suspended between the Trump and Biden administrations \u2014 at a moment when the rampaging pandemic has prompted deep concerns over the strength, timing and even likelihood of a possible recovery next year. On Tuesday, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. tried to inject a sense of urgency \u2014 and stability \u2014 into a chaotic postelection environment by formally introducing his economic team, whose governing philosophy marks a stark departure from President Trump\u2019s low-tax, low-regulation approach. \u201cLet\u2019s begin the work to heal, to unite, to rebuild an economy for all Americans,\u201d Mr. Biden said at an event in Wilmington, Del. The new team, led by Mr. Biden\u2019s pick for Treasury Secretary, Janet L. Yellen, the former Fed chair, will emphasize the need to immediately help households and businesses stay afloat amid the pandemic through the use of emergency appropriations and other forms of federal assistance, Biden aides have said. During his remarks, Mr. Biden directly appealed to senators who will vote on the confirmations of his cabinet members and who are likely to oppose some of his picks. \u201cTo the United States Senate, I hope those outstanding, these outstanding nominees receive a prompt hearing and that we will be able to work across the aisle in good faith and move forward as one country,\u201d said Mr. Biden as he introduced his nominees including Neera Tanden, the combative head of a liberal think tank who is one choice likely to face some opposition. Earlier in the day, current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell backed that approach, warning Congress that \u201cthe outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain\u201d without an effort to bridge the dangerous transition by limiting the spread of the virus and supporting the economy. Mr. Trump\u2019s departing Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, offered a much less dire assessment of the economy in his prepared remarks before the Senate Banking Committee. But there were signs that the two sides were attempting to bridge the gap. Mr. Mnuchin told reporters he was planning to reach out to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to discuss negotiations over another virus relief package. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin III, a Democrat from West Virginia, unveiled the blueprint for a $900 billion stopgap stimulus package later in the day. The plan would provide $300 a week in federal unemployment benefits for 18 weeks, half of what Democrats have sought, and it includes $160 billion in funding for state and local governments, much less than the $500 billion Democrats had previously proposed, which congressional Republicans and the White House had firmly rejected. In his testimony, Mr. Mnuchin proposed spending an additional $300 billion on relief \u2014 a move that was instantly attacked as insufficient by Democratic members of the panel. \u201cI continue to believe that a targeted fiscal package is the most appropriate federal response,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said on Tuesday. \u201cThe administration is standing ready to support Congress in this effort to help American workers and small businesses.\u201d Yet even as most congressional Republicans refuse to publicly acknowledge Mr. Biden\u2019s victory, many in the party are starting to privately adjust to negotiating with a Biden team whose coordinated activity represents a sharp break from Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s approach that had often involved back-room diplomacy with Democrats beyond the reach of his volatile boss.",

    "article_text": "Biden Pick for Treasury\u2019s No. 2, a Moderate Voice, Breaks Racial Barrier WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaking at a Washington think tank in the summer of 2016, Adewale Adeyemo, President Barack Obama\u2019s international economics adviser, warned about the perils of protectionism, explained how a growing Chinese economy was good for the world and talked up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal he helped negotiate that Democrats ultimately rejected. Four years later, such talk might sound out of touch with a Democratic Party that has become even more hawkish on China and increasingly wary of sprawling international trade deals. But that was not a concern for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who this week tapped Mr. Adeyemo to be deputy Treasury secretary, solidifying his team with another stalwart veteran of the Obama administration who would bring center-left economic ideas, deep experience and diversity to Mr. Biden\u2019s top ranks. Like many of Mr. Biden\u2019s hires so far, Mr. Adeyemo, who goes by Wally, brings a mainstream policy perspective with a background that breaks barriers. Mr. Adeyemo would be part of a history-making duo at Treasury: He would be the first Black deputy at the Treasury, serving with the first female secretary, Janet L. Yellen. And like some of Mr. Biden\u2019s picks, the selection of Mr. Adeyemo is coming under scrutiny from the left over his private-sector work. In 2017, after the Trump administration took over, Mr. Adeyemo went to work for BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, as a senior adviser and interim chief of staff to Larry Fink, its chief executive. He left last year to become president of the Obama Foundation, where he managed day-to-day operations and carried out its strategic plan. If confirmed, Mr. Adeyemo will have risen to the Treasury\u2019s No. 2 spot from humble beginnings. Born in Nigeria, he emigrated with his parents to the United States when he was a baby and settled in Southern California outside Los Angeles. His father was a teacher, his mother a nurse. Mr. Adeyemo, 39, and his younger brother and sister grew up sharing a room in a two-bedroom apartment. As he was introduced by Mr. Biden on Tuesday, Mr. Adeyemo talked about his desire to reduce inequality in the United States and increase the fortunes of the middle class. He described his roots growing up in a state that was hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cIn California\u2019s Inland Empire, where I had grown up in a working-class neighborhood, the Great Recession hit us hard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were one of the foreclosure capitals of the United States. The pain of this was real for me.\u201d Mr. Adeyemo attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he was the president of the students\u2019 association, and went on to get a law degree from Yale. His interest in policy percolating, he worked on the presidential campaigns of John Kerry, John Edwards and Mr. Obama. Mr. Adeyemo joined the Treasury Department in 2009, working as deputy executive secretary to Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Just over a year later, he was dispatched to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to help get the new agency up and running. There, he worked as chief of staff for Elizabeth Warren, now a senator from Massachusetts, who had come up with the idea for the consumer bureau and was picked by Mr. Obama to oversee the agency\u2019s establishment. The ability to toggle between the likes of Mr. Geithner and Ms. Warren was an early sign of Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s knack for straddling the moderate and progressive wings of the Democratic Party\u2019s policymaking machine. At his 2015 confirmation hearing to be the Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for international markets and development, Ms. Warren offered effusive praise. \u201cHe remembers who he grew up with, and he tries every day to make this a better country,\u201d said Ms. Warren, who became one of the most prominent progressives within the Democratic Party. A spokeswoman said Ms. Warren would support Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s nomination as deputy secretary. Mr. Adeyemo ultimately became deputy chief of staff at the Treasury, serving under Jacob J. Lew. In that role, he was immersed in many issues including sanctions and international trade. During the negotiations over the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Adeyemo was focused on brokering a deal over currency provisions in the agreement\u2019s foreign exchange chapter. Mr. Lew recalled Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s flying across the world from Asia to Latin America and engaging in economic shuttle diplomacy to broker an agreement that would create greater transparency and enforcement of foreign exchange policy in the deal. \u201cHe put together an approach that frankly has withstood the test of time, even though TPP has not had U.S. participation,\u201d Mr. Lew said in an interview. \u201cIt became the model of how currency issues were dealt with in subsequent trade agreements.\u201d In 2015, Mr. Obama recruited Mr. Adeyemo to the White House to be his international economic adviser on the National Security Council. He represented the president at the Group of 20 and Group of 7 summits and steered the international economic policy agenda across government agencies. The soft-spoken and deliberate Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s approach will provide a stark contrast to the Trump administration\u2019s combative tone in economic diplomacy. At the 2016 event sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Mr. Adeyemo described the importance of encouraging China to liberalize its markets by making the case that doing so was in its own economic interests \u2014 and in the interests of the United States. \u201cA growing Chinese economy is an economy where U.S. companies can sell goods and services,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a growing Chinese economy is something that will help boost global growth.\u201d That multilateral approach to dealing with China could be a complication for Mr. Adeyemo at his confirmation hearing, as Republicans have become accustomed to Mr. Trump\u2019s confrontational stance. And Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s work at BlackRock will probably raise questions from some Democrats, as progressives have already expressed their displeasure. Robert Kuttner, founder of The American Prospect, a progressive publication, warned this week that BlackRock could stand to gain if Mr. Adeyemo got the No. 2 job at the Treasury, saying he could work to prevent tougher regulatory oversight of the asset manager. Matt Stoller, the director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, a left-leaning group that targets corporate power, suggested that BlackRock worked to implant officials that would do its bidding inside the federal government. \u201cBlackRock needs to be broken up and regulated,\u201d Mr. Stoller said. \u201cBlackRock C.E.O. Larry Fink knows this, so he\u2019s been storing hack Democrats on ice so they can go into the Biden administration and make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d A BlackRock spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. A Biden transition team aide said Mr. Adeyemo, who was hired to establish BlackRock\u2019s internal think tank, did not have any business responsibility for or oversight of its investments or policy decisions. The aide said the experience also deepened Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s understanding of financial markets and the role that firms like BlackRock play in creating wealth for the middle class. David S. Cohen, the Treasury\u2019s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence during the Obama administration, said Mr. Adeyemo\u2019s familiarity with the inner workings of the Treasury and experience with domestic policy, international economics and national security would make him a strong partner for Ms. Yellen, who is an academic economist and former central banker. \u201cIn some respects, he\u2019s a perfect complement to Yellen at Treasury,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.",

    "article_text": "The World in a Vise: Sounding the Alarm on China, Then Running for Shelter SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 For the past few years, Australia has positioned itself at the front of a global effort to stand up to China. It was the first country to ban Huawei\u2019s 5G technology, to pass foreign interference laws aimed at curbing Chinese influence, and to call for an international inquiry into the source of the coronavirus. Now, Australia is sounding an even louder alarm. Prime Minister Scott Morrison, already vexed by China\u2019s blockade of Australian imports \u2014 wine, coal, barley and cotton \u2014 demanded on Monday that the Chinese government apologize for a lurid tweet showing an Australian soldier with a knife at the neck of an Afghan child. The world, he warned, was watching. But even as he elevated a Twitter post to a four-alarm diplomatic fire, he also called for a reset with Beijing, reiterating that Australia\u2019s end game was still \u201cthe happy coexistence of two partners.\u201d In that somersault, Mr. Morrison inadvertently let the world hear Australia\u2019s internal dialogue of doubt \u2014 one that echoes around the globe as China increasingly asserts its might. The prime minister gave voice to the insecurities and anxieties that come with being caught between two superpowers. Those jitters are partly about the limited options in the face of China\u2019s tightening vise. But they are also about an America in flux. At a time when Australia\u2019s favored nation status with the Trump White House is about to expire, there is widespread concern that a Biden administration will focus less on America\u2019s Pacific partners and more on rebuilding ties in Europe. That has pushed Australia deeper into a position of pleading for help in corralling China even as it beats its chest for sovereignty. \u201cOn one level, the prime minister\u2019s reaction was completely reasonable. On another, it\u2019s at the upper limit of what\u2019s acceptable without making things worse,\u201d said John Blaxland, a professor of international security at the Australian National University. \u201cHe\u2019s got to tread a very fine line because Australia\u2019s leverage is limited.\u201d The country\u2019s entire history since settlement has been shaped by unquestioned dependence on an alliance with a distant and dominant power, first England, then the United States. The prospect of an end to that stability, with American decline or indifference and Chinese dominance, fills most Australians with dread. David Brophy, a senior lecturer in modern Chinese history at the University of Sydney, said it had created a counterintuitive dynamic. China often condemns Australia for doing America\u2019s bidding, when in fact, Australia is trying desperately to cajole the United States into deeper engagement. \u201cThe American presence in Asia is more important for Australia than it is for America,\u201d Mr. Brophy said. \u201cWhen Australia sees any hint of withdrawal, as we saw at the beginning of the Trump administration, it stirs up this sense of panic. It\u2019s not enough to wait for the U.S. to get back in the game; Australia has to show it can do more and will do more.\u201d Increasingly, that has meant tolerating economic pain and abandoning the approach Australia has long followed with China \u2014 say little and do what must be done. Mr. Morrison\u2019s government and China\u2019s propaganda machine have instead been trading blows and turns at the microphone. Geoff Raby, a former Australian ambassador to China, described it as a self-perpetuating cycle of paranoid provocation. \u201cThey are each confirming the other\u2019s worst suspicions,\u201d he said. Whispered complaints are out, replaced by competing news conferences and laundry lists of grievances. Australia has launched two foreign interference investigations with high-profile raids. It now plans to file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over China\u2019s blocking of barley imports \u2014 one of many products that China has rejected as tensions have soared. Two weeks ago, in turn, a pair of Chinese Embassy officials summoned an Australian reporter to a meeting and delivered a set of 14 grievances. They included academic visa cancellations, \u201ca crusade\u201d against China\u2019s policies in Hong Kong, a call for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19, a ban on Huawei in 2018, and the blocking of 10 Chinese foreign investment deals. \u201cIf you make China the enemy, China will be the enemy,\u201d one of the officials said. Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (and the official who posted the doctored photo), called at the time for Australia to \u201creflect on this seriously, rather than shirking the blame and deflecting responsibility.\u201d That, of course, is exactly what the Australian government has demanded from China with the coronavirus inquiry, which Beijing treated like a dropped grenade. Explosive exchanges and accusations of hypocrisy now seem to come in volleys. The tweet from Mr. Zhao, a known provocateur, had an obvious goal: to deflect criticism of China\u2019s human rights abuses by sensationalizing an investigation by the Australian military that found its troops had unlawfully killed 39 Afghan civilians and prisoners over an 11-year period. Mr. Morrison could have ignored the provocation. Instead, he pounced, and after Mr. Morrison\u2019s apology demand, the Chinese government paid little mind to his request for a reset and dialogue. The official response arrived a few hours later when a government spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, suggested that Australia seemed to be indifferent to the killings. \u201cThe Australian side is reacting so strongly to my colleague\u2019s tweet. Does this mean they think the cruel killing of Afghan lives is justified?\u201d Ms. Hua said. An editorial in the state-run Global Times added: \u201cThe Morrison administration is making Australia provocative and wanting a spanking.\u201d And on Tuesday, China accused Australia of intentionally \u201cmisreading\u201d the tweet to deflect criticism. Beyond the juvenile threats lies a more serious and intractable disconnect. In the eyes of China\u2019s most nationalist ideologues, Australia is violating the most basic rule of China\u2019s rise: If you get rich with our help, stay quiet and grateful. Few countries have gained as much wealth from China\u2019s growth as Australia, and since coming to power in 2012, Xi Jinping has made clear that he expects silence and harmony from all who benefit from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s prosperity. \u201cNever allow singing to a tune contrary to the party center,\u201d he once wrote in comments that appeared on party and university websites in 2014. \u201cNever allow eating the Communist Party\u2019s food and then smashing the Communist Party\u2019s cooking pots.\u201d In the case of Mr. Zhao\u2019s tweet, Mr. Xi has said nothing \u2014 further highlighting the asymmetry of Mr. Morrison\u2019s complaint about a spokesman\u2019s social media post. To some of Mr. Morrison\u2019s critics, the photo looked like internet trolling that he should have ignored or responded to at a lower level. \u201cThey seem to have intended to make Morrison angry, and to goad him into exactly the kind of emotional response that he has now given them,\u201d said Hugh White, a former intelligence official who teaches strategic studies at the Australian National University. \u201cAnd that is worrying. In any fight like this one, be very careful not to do what your adversary wants you to do.\u201d Whether Mr. Morrison gets any aid from the United States or elsewhere, Mr. White added, the episode has already made Australia and Mr. Morrison \u201clook rattled and weak.\u201d That makes China look more powerful and intimidating. \u201cThe folks in Beijing do not want us to like them,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThey want us to understand their power and their willingness to use it. Our problem is that we are being rather slow to realize that their power is real.\u201d Chris Buckley contributed reporting.",

The U.S. economy is in a precarious state and Congress is consumed by partisan politics. Ms. Yellen, however, is no stranger to crisis or political machinations. She served as a top economic adviser in the Clinton White House. She was among the first economists to spot the housing bubble. And as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, she helped navigate the country through the last major financial emergency. Now, facing another steep challenge, we review her history-making career and look at the measures she might take to get the economy humming again. Jeanna Smialek, who covers the Federal Reserve and the economy for The New York Times. Ms. Yellen became an economist when few women entered the discipline. She is now set to become the first female Treasury secretary and one of the few people ever to have wielded economic power from the White House, the Federal Reserve and the president\u2019s cabinet. While she may have excelled at some big jobs in the past, this role may be her hardest yet. There are a lot of ways to listen to The Daily. Here\u2019s how. We want to hear from you.

    "article_text": "For Manchin, a Divided Senate Is a \u2018Golden Opportunity\u2019 for Action WASHINGTON \u2014 A year ago, Joe Manchin III was ready to quit. As the most conservative Senate Democrat, he saw nothing but dysfunction and inaction when he looked around on Capitol Hill. \u201cThis place sucks,\u201d he repeatedly declared. As he often has since arriving in Washington, he openly mulled leaving to try to reclaim his old job: governor of West Virginia. Instead, he stayed for a second term. Now, with President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. preparing to govern from the middle in a Congress whose thin majorities will force him to compromise on almost every priority, Mr. Manchin, a centrist, suddenly finds himself at the center of relevance in the nation\u2019s capital. In his office on a recent afternoon, seated not far from a framed quote from President John F. Kennedy stressing independence from political party, Mr. Manchin, 73, was feeling energized. He paged through a proposal he was developing for a new coronavirus relief deal and said he was imagining a more moderate course for Congress. \u201cI think we have a golden opportunity to bring the country back together and for us to work in the middle,\u201d Mr. Manchin said excitedly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the reason why: The numbers are so close with what the Democratic House members lost. For Nancy Pelosi, she\u2019s going to have to work with people that have a more moderate view than some of the people that pushed her from the left.\u201d If Democrats are able to win two runoffs in Georgia in January and take control of the Senate, any plans to enact a liberal agenda \u2014 such as increasing the number of Supreme Court justices \u2014 will have to go through Mr. Manchin. Likewise, if Republicans win at least one of the Georgia races, allowing them to maintain Senate control, they will need centrists in both parties to help block progressive items or pass compromise legislation. That is the situation that Mr. Manchin said he considered more likely. He is already preparing for a power dynamic that he asserted would give him and three moderate Republicans \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah \u2014 a big role in determining what happens at the dawn of Mr. Biden\u2019s presidency. With Vice President-elect Kamala Harris empowered to break ties, Mr. Manchin noted that it would take only two Republican defections to hand Democrats a majority on any given measure. \u201cIt behooves everybody to start working together,\u201d he said during a wide-ranging interview in his office. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t take many of us to say, \u2018Guys, we\u2019ve given all of you a chance. We haven\u2019t done our job for the last 10 years, and we\u2019re going to start.\u2019\u201d In recent days, Mr. Manchin has been working to corral support for a new coronavirus stimulus package, racing around the Capitol asking his colleagues what price range they are comfortable with and directing his chief of staff, Lance West, to draw up proposals. Mr. Manchin said he thought about $1.2 trillion might be acceptable to finally reach a deal \u2014 about half of what his party\u2019s leaders had been pushing for before the election. He has been in talks with a bipartisan group of senators to try to forge a deal. They include the three Republican moderates, as well as Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana; Senator Angus King, independent of Maine; and the Democratic senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Mark Warner of Virginia. \u201cSomething needs to be done before Joe Biden becomes president,\u201d Mr. Manchin said. \u201cI\u2019ve got people who aren\u2019t going to make it to February or March.\u201d He is also ready to do battle with the progressive left, whose ire he drew when, in an interview this month with the Washington Examiner, he responded to a question about some liberals\u2019 calls to defund the police with the phrase, \u201cDefund, my butt.\u201d In response, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive firebrand from New York, posted a photo on Twitter of her glaring at Mr. Manchin as he applauded during President Trump\u2019s second State of the Union address. \u201cI guess she put the dagger stare on me,\u201d Mr. Manchin said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the young lady \u2014 I really don\u2019t. I never met her. I\u2019m understanding she\u2019s not that active with her bills or in committee. She\u2019s more active on Twitter than anything else.\u201d That amounts to a sharp insult in a chamber where legislative prowess is prized. Mr. Manchin said he would stand firm against the agenda that the left flank of his party is pushing. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to defund the police, we\u2019re not for the new green deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. We\u2019re not for Medicare for All \u2014 we can\u2019t even pay for Medicare for some.\u201d Lauren Hitt, a spokeswoman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, said the congresswoman had submitted more amendments than 90 percent of other freshmen \u2014 including those promoting fair housing and a tear gas ban that passed the House \u2014 and had missed fewer votes than Mr. Manchin. \u201cThe congresswoman has earned a reputation as a tough, prepared member in committee hearings,\u201d Ms. Hitt said. Mr. Manchin is also a staunch opponent of another step for which progressives have advocated, having loudly spoken out against a move to change Senate rules so that the majority could muscle through legislation with a vote of 51, rather than requiring that bills meet a 60-vote threshold to advance. Should Democrats win control of the chamber, the change would allow Mr. Biden to circumvent Republican opposition and push through his policy priorities. \u201cI can assure you I will not vote to end the filibuster, because that would break the Senate,\u201d Mr. Manchin said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got to blow up the Senate to do the right thing, then we\u2019ve got the wrong people in the Senate.\u201d Instead, Mr. Manchin said he and a group of like-minded senators in both parties \u2014 including many of those with whom he is discussing a new relief package \u2014 were eyeing a different change to the rules to empower the rank and file. Their idea is to allow any bill approved by a committee with bipartisan support to advance to the floor. That would dilute the unilateral power of the majority leader \u2014 currently Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky \u2014 to control which measures advance. \u201cBefore we know definitely who is going to be the majority leader, we should make the changes of how the Senate should work,\u201d Mr. Manchin said of the proposal, which is exceedingly unlikely to be successful. Still, John C. Kilwein, the chairman of the political science department at West Virginia University, said Mr. Manchin would be \u201cincredibly important\u201d in the event of a 50-50 Senate. His stances would also serve as useful cover for Mr. Biden and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, from criticism they are likely to face for not fully embracing the progressive agenda. \u201cHe dashed progressives\u2019 hopes already of doing away with the filibuster and packing the court,\u201d Mr. Kilwein said. In some ways, Mr. Manchin is a throwback to a bygone era. A gun owner who grew up in the small town of Farmington, W.Va., and lives on a houseboat while in Washington, he keeps photographs of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting on his office wall. Teaming up with Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, Mr. Manchin tried in 2013 to craft some modest gun safety measures to prevent such mass killings from happening again, but their efforts stalled amid bipartisan opposition. He often describes having learned to govern with \u201ccommon sense\u201d from watching small-town officials navigate problems like whether to put in or take out a stoplight. Charles S. Trump IV, a Republican state senator from West Virginia who has known Mr. Manchin for three decades and is not related to the president, said the senator took after his uncle A. James Manchin, an \u201cicon of West Virginia politics.\u201d The elder Mr. Manchin was an entertaining politician who rid the state\u2019s countryside of thousands of junked cars and old tires. As the state\u2019s working-class rural white voters \u2014 who once voted for Democrats partly because of strong ties to labor unions \u2014 shifted to the right, few Democrats could continue to win in West Virginia. The president won the state by nearly 40 percentage points this year. But Mr. Manchin held onto his seat in 2018, surviving the steepest re-election challenge of his career partly on the strength of the trust he has built with constituents over decades. Mr. Trump, the state senator, recalled how Mr. Manchin as governor cut short a trip in 2006 to attend the Sugar Bowl in Atlanta, where he planned to cheer on the West Virginia University Mountaineers, when there was a mine disaster back home. \u201cHe came straight home,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe knew it would be important to the people during a crisis that he was there.\u201d This year, Mr. Manchin crossed party lines when he became the only Democratic senator to endorse Ms. Collins in her fourth re-election attempt against a strong challenger, Sara Gideon, whom many in Congress expected to win. When Ms. Collins defied the polls, Mr. Manchin was one of the first to call and congratulate her. \u201cHe\u2019s courageous,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cI admire he does the things he believes are right, even if he gets a lot of grief from the Democratic leader for it.\u201d Ms. Collins said she looked forward to working with Mr. Manchin on issues such as reducing the price of prescription drugs and a broad infrastructure package. But the obstacles are steep, with powerful groups on both sides of the political spectrum \u201cdemanding 100 percent compliance\u201d with their views, she said. Ms. Murkowski said she hoped a functioning Senate was not \u201ca pipe dream from a bygone era.\u201d \u201cFor those of us more in the moderate camp, it\u2019s a very important role that needs to be played, and I\u2019m looking forward to playing a part in that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the bitter partisan divide we\u2019ve seen. I want to try to figure out how we are governing again for all the country, not just for the Republicans.\u201d",

    "article_text": "It\u2019s Time for a Woman to Run the Defense Department President-elect Joe Biden has begun to announce his intended cabinet nominees, and it\u2019s an impressive and diverse group: his picks include an experienced African-American diplomat for ambassador to the United Nations; the first Latino nominated as homeland security secretary; and the first woman tapped to serve as director of national intelligence. Mr. Biden has remained silent, however, about whom he might select as secretary of defense. For years, the betting has been on Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, an under secretary of defense for policy in the Obama administration who is widely viewed as one of the nation\u2019s top defense policy experts. But although Ms. Flournoy \u2014 for whom I worked from 2009 to 2011 \u2014 is reported to still be a leading contender, along with a number of other well-regarded women, there has recently been speculation that Mr. Biden may instead choose one of several men also said to be on his short list. That would be shortsighted. If Mr. Biden nominates a respected and highly qualified woman as his secretary of defense, he would send an important and long overdue message \u2014 that the Defense Department\u2019s old norms and biases were a disservice not only to women working in national security, but to the country. The Defense Department has long been viewed as singularly inhospitable to women. National security leaders (nearly always male) have for years argued that there just weren\u2019t enough qualified female candidates to fill senior positions in the Defense Department \u2014 an excuse that might once have had some validity, but rings hollow today. Over the last two decades, an impressive new generation of female defense experts has emerged. There are now scores of talented women who have spent years mastering everything from military strategy to budgeting, logistics and acquisitions. In September, the Leadership Council for Women in National Security \u2014 which I co-founded and whose advisers include such luminaries as former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and retired Adm. Michelle Howard, the Navy\u2019s first female African-American four-star \u2014 provided the Biden transition team with the names of at least four qualified women for every Senate-confirmed national security position. If it took decades for a sizable pool of highly qualified women to emerge as potential senior Pentagon leaders, that\u2019s no accident. For most of our nation\u2019s history, overtly discriminatory legislation and Defense Department rules severely limited women\u2019s ability to rise. In recent years, even as other foreign policy agencies opened their senior ranks to women, the doors at the Pentagon remained largely closed. At the end of the Obama administration, for instance, women made up 41 percent of senior State Department officials, but just 22 percent of senior Defense Department civilian officials, according to a 2018 analysis conducted by New America. In the uniformed military, gender equality has proved even more elusive than racial equality. Racial discrimination in the military was barred by a 1948 executive order, and the first African-American four-star general was appointed in 1975. In 1989, the first African-American chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was appointed. But in the very same year the military was ordered to integrate racially, Congress also passed legislation mandating that women make up no more than 2 percent of military personnel \u2014 a cap that was lifted only in the 1970s. Even today, women constitute only 16.5 percent of the active duty force, and the first female four-star general wasn\u2019t appointed until 2008. Until 2015, women were also barred from serving in combat roles. This made it difficult for women to gain senior military positions, which go mostly to those with distinguished combat records. And since nearly half of all Defense Department civilian employees are military veterans who get preferential hiring, the same discriminatory policies that kept most uniformed women out of senior jobs also made it tougher for civilian women to be hired and promoted on an equal basis. These laws and policies weren\u2019t just unfair to women, they also diminished the country\u2019s ability to develop smart, effective national security policies. Studies suggest that organizations with gender-diverse leadership teams outperform organizations with male-dominated leadership, and that diverse organizations are less prone to \u201cgroupthink.\u201d On average, women appear to have more collaborative leadership styles than men, and they\u2019re also less likely than men to fall prey to judgment errors induced by overconfidence. Wouldn\u2019t it be wiser to have more collaboration, less groupthink and less recklessness in our military policy? The United States faces national security problems ranging from the pandemic to climate change, refugee crises and the rise of near-peer competitors such as China. These complex and interconnected issues require fresh approaches, not a reversion to old modes of thinking about defense policy. If Mr. Biden chooses a woman as his secretary of defense, it will pack a uniquely powerful symbolic punch \u2014 signaling both his repudiation of the Defense Department\u2019s history of sex-based discrimination and his intent to build the kind of diverse, innovative national security leadership team the nation so urgently needs. Rosa Brooks, a professor at Georgetown Law and a co-founder of the Leadership Council for Women in National Security, is the author of \u201cHow Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cTangled Up in Blue: Policing the American City.\u201d The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "article_text": "Biden\u2019s Economic Team Suggests Focus on Workers and Income Equality WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. formally announced his top economic advisers on Monday, choosing a team that is stocked with champions of organized labor and marginalized workers, signaling an early focus on efforts to speed and spread the gains of the recovery from the pandemic recession. The selections build on a pledge Mr. Biden made to business groups two weeks ago, when he said labor unions would have \u201cincreased power\u201d in his administration. They suggest that Mr. Biden\u2019s team will be focused initially on increased federal spending to reduce unemployment and an expanded safety net to cushion households that have continued to suffer as the coronavirus persists and the recovery slows. In a sign that Mr. Biden plans to focus on spreading economic wealth, his transition team put issues of equality and worker empowerment at the forefront of its news release announcing the nominees, saying they would help create \u201can economy that gives every single person across America a fair shot and an equal chance to get ahead.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s picks include Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, as Treasury secretary; Cecilia Rouse of Princeton University, to head the White House Council of Economic Advisers; and Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress think tank, to run the Office of Management and Budget. All three have focused on efforts to increase worker earnings and reduce racial and gender discrimination in the economy. Ms. Tanden said in February that rising income inequality was the consequence of \u201cdecades of conservative attacks on workers\u2019 right to organize\u201d and that labor unions \u201care a powerful vehicle to move workers into the middle class and keep them there.\u201d The two other nominees to Mr. Biden\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, are economists who have pushed for policies to advance workers and labor rights, and who advised Mr. Biden in his campaign as he built an agenda that featured several longstanding goals of organized labor, like raising the federal minimum wage and strengthening \u201cBuy America\u201d requirements in federal contracting. Ms. Boushey has also been a vocal advocate of policies to help working families, including providing up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. In an interview last week, Ms. Boushey said such a policy was especially critical during the pandemic, \u201cwhen lives are at stake.\u201d William E. Spriggs, the chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. labor union, hailed the selections, saying in an email on Monday that \u201cwe have not had a C.E.A. as focused on the role of fiscal policy and full employment since President Johnson.\u201d The team has embraced increased federal spending to help households and businesses during the pandemic, a position that was highlighted in an op-ed article that Ms. Tanden and Ms. Boushey wrote with two co-authors in March, urging policymakers to spend big even though it would require borrowing large sums of money. \u201cGiven the magnitude of the crisis,\u201d they wrote, \u201cnow is not the time for policymakers to worry about raising deficits and debt as they consider what steps to take.\u201d Mr. Biden also named Adewale Adeyemo, a senior international economic adviser in the Obama administration, as deputy Treasury secretary. The nominees, who require Senate confirmation, will be introduced on Tuesday. Another of Mr. Biden\u2019s picks, the former Obama adviser Brian Deese, has been tapped to lead the National Economic Council but was not included in Monday\u2019s announcement. Mr. Biden\u2019s team includes several labor economists, including Ms. Yellen, who has been a longtime champion of workers and has at times suggested allowing the unemployment rate to run low for a longer period of time without worrying about inflation \u2014 an idea some economists thought imprudent but which has since become more widely accepted. While at the Fed, she balanced her preference for a strong labor market with inflation concerns and political constraints. In the early 2000s, Ms. Yellen was instrumental in persuading the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee to coalesce around targeting a 2 percent inflation rate instead of the zero inflation rate that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chair at the time, originally favored. The Fed raises rates to slow the economy and offset inflationary pressures, so targeting slightly higher inflation opened the door to longer periods of cheap borrowing that can lead to stronger economic demand and lower unemployment. As Fed chair from 2014 to 2018, Ms. Yellen favored a patient approach to policy-setting that weighed concerns that prices might heat up as joblessness dropped against a preference for pulling more workers into the labor market. In one wonky 2016 speech, she suggested that allowing the labor market to expand without raising interest rates might help to reverse damage by pulling people in from the sidelines and prompting others to look for better jobs. She was criticized for the remarks, and later backed away from such an approach in word if not in deed. She and her colleagues lifted interest rates to fend off inflation pressures, but did so at a very slow pace, prompting criticism. Those rate increases have since been viewed as too aggressive and faulted for prematurely snuffing out a more robust labor market expansion. Ms. Yellen also walked a careful line when it came to issues like inequality. In one 2014 speech, she suggested that widening income and wealth inequality might be incompatible with American values \u2014 \u201camong them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity\u201d \u2014 a remark Republicans criticized. Much has changed since Ms. Yellen was at the Fed \u2014 in ways that could allow her to embrace some of her more labor-friendly instincts if she is confirmed to the Treasury. While the Treasury secretary\u2019s direct economic power is somewhat limited, the position holds significant sway as a fiscal policy adviser to Congress and the president, as well as oversight of tax policy through the Internal Revenue Service. Inflation, once seen as a real and looming threat, has been low for more than a decade. Inequality, once labeled a political and liberal issue, is increasingly recognized as a real economic constraint by Democrats and Republicans alike. Yet some progressive groups have raised concerns that Mr. Biden\u2019s team could pivot too quickly to try to reduce the federal budget deficit once the pandemic subsides, citing past comments by Ms. Yellen and Ms. Tanden. Economists on the left have become increasingly comfortable with deficit spending, and Ms. Yellen has long favored government intervention as a way to get the economy going during times of trouble. But she has also said America\u2019s debt load is unsustainable, and has generally favored taxation as an offset to increased spending. Mr. Biden, too, has expressed support for borrowing money to aid the current recovery, but sought to offset the cost of other economic proposals \u2014 like an infrastructure bill and actions to mitigate climate change \u2014 with tax increases on high earners and corporations. In a 2018 interview at the Charles Schwab Impact conference in Washington, Ms. Yellen said the U.S. debt path was \u201cunsustainable\u201d and offered a remedy: \u201cIf I had a magic wand, I would raise taxes and cut retirement spending.\u201d Last year, she described the need to overhaul the nation\u2019s social safety net programs as \u201croot canal economics.\u201d But Ms. Yellen has made clear that she does not see deficit reduction as a priority during the current crisis and that the federal government should spend what is necessary to weather the pandemic. In July, she testified before Congress with Ben S. Bernanke, another former Fed chair, and called for substantial federal support. \u201cWith interest rates extremely low and likely to remain so for some time, we do not believe that concerns about the deficit and debt should prevent the Congress from responding robustly to this emergency,\u201d she said. \u201cThe top priorities at this time should be protecting our citizens from the pandemic and pursuing a stronger and equitable economic recovery.\u201d Many Republicans, however, have once again begun warning about the deficit and citing mounting debt levels as a reason to avoid another large virus spending package. Bridging those concerns will fall to both Ms. Yellen and Ms. Tanden, whose role as the White House budget director will put her in the center of fiscal fights with Congress. Some liberal groups have raised concerns over Ms. Tanden\u2019s 2012 remarks to C-SPAN about potential cuts to safety-net programs as part of a long-term deal to reduce federal debt. In that interview with the network, Ms. Tanden said that the restructuring of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid must be \u201con the table\u201d in conversations about long-term deficit reduction and noted that the Center for American Progress had made such proposals. But in 2017, as Republicans prepared to approve a $1.5 trillion tax cut, Ms. Tanden showed no desire to return to deficit reduction in a future administration. \u201cThe rule seems to be deficits only matter for Democratic presidents,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cAnd that rule needs to die now. We should not have to clean up their mess.\u201d Liberal senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, cheered the selections of Mr. Biden\u2019s team, including Ms. Yellen and Ms. Tanden. Mr. Brown said on Twitter that Ms. Tanden was \u201csmart, experienced, and qualified\u201d and demanded that Senate Republicans confirm Mr. Biden\u2019s team. Republicans did not unite in opposition, though when asked about Ms. Yellen, Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, criticized her as being a \u201cgood example of the corporate liberals.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s somebody who clearly has done the bidding of the big multinational corporations,\u201d he said. \u201cHer record on trade is astoundingly terrible.\u201d Liberal economists welcomed the picks. \u201cThere are reasons to be hopeful,\u201d said Stephanie Kelton, a professor at Stony Brook University and the author of the book \u201cThe Deficit Myth,\u201d which makes a case that budget deficits are not inherently bad. Ms. Kelton helped with economic agenda-setting during the Biden campaign as a task force member, and said the fact that people like Mr. Bernstein and Ms. Boushey were included among the economic thinkers was a reason to hope that progressive ideals would have a voice at the table. That said, Ms. Kelton said she remained wary that there would be continued attention to deficits and deficit reduction.",

Pai, the Republican chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said Monday that he would leave his post the day that President-elect Joseph R.

Mr. Pai\u2019s most prominent effort was rolling back net neutrality rules that forbid internet providers from blocking content, slowing down its delivery or charging for higher priority on their networks. His Democratic predecessor put the rules in place with the support of liberal activists over the opposition of companies like AT&T and Comcast. But Mr. Pai undid the rules within a year of being appointed by President Trump. Mr. Pai eliminated lower-profile rules governing the telecommunications industry, loosening media ownership restrictions and lifting some price caps in the lucrative market for business broadband connections. He also faced a global race to develop next generation wireless networks and more recently was drawn into the debate over the rules governing social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube. He was widely expected to step down after Mr. Biden won the presidential election.",

    "article_text": "\u2018Trump Is Better\u2019: In Asia, Pro-Democracy Forces Worry About Biden BANGKOK \u2014 A dissident once branded Enemy No. 1 by the Chinese Communist Party is spreading conspiracy theories about the American presidential election. Pro-democracy campaigners from Hong Kong are championing President Trump\u2019s claims of an electoral victory. Human rights activists and religious leaders in Vietnam and Myanmar are expressing reservations about President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s ability to keep authoritarians in check. It might seem counterintuitive that Asian defenders of democracy are among the most ardent supporters of Mr. Trump, who has declared his friendship with Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un of North Korea. But it is precisely Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to flout diplomatic protocol, abandon international accords and keep his opponents off-balance that have earned him plaudits as a leader strong enough to stand up to dictators and defend democratic ideals overseas, even if he has been criticized as diminishing them at home. As President-elect Biden assembles his foreign-policy team, prominent human rights activists across Asia are worried about his desire for the United States to hew again to international norms. They believe that Mr. Biden, like former President Barack Obama, will pursue accommodation rather than confrontation in the face of China\u2019s assertive moves. And their pro-Trump views have been cemented by online misinformation, often delivered by dubious news sources, that Mr. Biden is working in tandem with communists or is a closet socialist sympathizer. \u201cBiden is president, and it\u2019s like having Xi Jinping sitting in the White House,\u201d said Elmer Yuen, a Hong Kong entrepreneur who has posted YouTube videos criticizing the Chinese Communist Party, or C.C.P. \u201cHe wants to coexist with China, and whoever coexists with the C.C.P. loses.\u201d With Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential tenure in its twilight, these activists are calling for the administration to make a final stand against Asian autocrats, similar to a last-ditch effort to expand the border wall with Mexico. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took a five-nation swing through Asia in October in which he abandoned politesse and described the Chinese government as a \u201cpredator,\u201d \u201clawless and threatening,\u201d and \u201cthe gravest threat to the future of religious freedom.\u201d The tour was meant as a counterweight to China in a region where Beijing\u2019s dollar diplomacy has bought significant influence. Earlier this month, Lobsang Sangay became the first head of the Tibetan government-in-exile to visit the White House; the provocative invite infuriated Beijing, which considers Mr. Sangay to be a separatist. In June, Mr. Pompeo attended a virtual gathering with the Hong Kong democracy leader Joshua Wong and President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, both of whom are loathed by the Chinese government. Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity is particularly enduring among Christians, such as Chinese-born legal scholars chafing against Communism\u2019s atheist core and ethnic minority activists in Southeast Asia. Mr. Pompeo and other Trump administration officials, they believe, have been fulfilling a faith-based mission overseas. Last year, Mr. Trump met in the White House with a group of religious leaders from across the world, including Hkalam Samson, the president of the Kachin Baptist Convention, which represents the persecuted Christian Kachin minority in Myanmar. \u201cMy experience in the White House, when I was given one minute to speak out about the Kachin, meant a lot, and it also meant that Trump cares about us,\u201d Mr. Samson said. \u201cTrump is better for the Kachin than Biden.\u201d Skepticism for Mr. Biden extends to those fighting for secular political rights as well. The president-elect\u2019s embrace of diplomatic custom will not work when only one side is playing fairly, they say. \u201cFor Biden\u2019s policies toward China, the part about making China play by the international rules, I think, is very hollow,\u201d said Wang Dan, who helped lead the 1989 Tiananmen protests as a university student. \u201cAs we know, the Chinese Communist Party hardly abides by international rules.\u201d \u201cThe United States must realize that there will be no improvements on human rights issues in China if there is no regime change,\u201d Mr. Wang added. He has continued to question Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral loss, baseless claims shared by other prominent Chinese-born dissidents. But others within the community, particularly in Hong Kong and China, said that backing Mr. Trump was hypocritical at best and dangerous at worst. \u201cTrump\u2019s human rights record \u2014 what he does to migrant children, the Muslim ban, white supremacy, alternative truth \u2014 removes him from my support, but this is apparently not the popular attitude among many dissidents in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan,\u201d said Badiucao, a China-born political artist who now lives in self-exile in Australia. Mr. Badiucao, who is known by a pseudonym to protect his family in China, has skirmished online with Mr. Wang and other well-known dissidents and has made the scuffle a topic for his art. \u201cThese guys are utilitarian, and they believe that if Trump is waging war against the C.C.P. then he\u2019s right for them,\u201d Mr. Badiucao said. \u201cThat mentality fits the whole \u2018America First\u2019 ideology, where it\u2019s OK for other people to suffer if your goal is met, and their goal is overthrowing the C.C.P.\u201d Over the past 12 months, the Trump administration has stepped up its actions in Asia. Late last year, the U.S. government barred military leaders from Myanmar from entering the country because of their role in what Mr. Pompeo called \u201cgross violations of human rights\u201d of Rohingya Muslims and other minority groups. Financial sanctions were also placed on individuals in Pakistan and Cambodia, among other countries, where civil liberties are under threat. This summer, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, and 10 others for \u201cundermining Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and restricting the freedom of expression or assembly of the citizens of Hong Kong.\u201d Four more officials were added to the sanctions list this month. In June, Mr. Trump signed legislation that led to sanctions being placed on Chinese officials who have overseen the construction of mass detention camps in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where more than a million people, mostly members of the Uighur Muslim minority, have been imprisoned. \u201cThe Trump administration by far has done more to raise our issue than all other countries combined,\u201d said Salih Hudayar, who was born in Xinjiang and moved to the United States as a child. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical of a Biden administration because I am worried he will allow China to go back to normal, which is a 21st-century genocide of the Uighurs.\u201d During the presidential campaign, Mr. Biden released a statement calling the situation in Xinjiang a \u201cgenocide.\u201d The Trump administration has not used such a designation, and a book by his former national security adviser said that Mr. Trump told Mr. Xi that he should continue building the detention camps in Xinjiang. Foreign policy advisers to Mr. Biden say that it is unfair to presume that he will continue the Obama administration\u2019s moderate stance. It is, they say, a different era. The recent human rights legislation championed by the Trump administration has received broad bipartisan support. And some Asian dissidents acknowledge that the antipathy toward Mr. Biden is driven in part by a deluge of online misinformation that paints the president-elect as a secret socialist or contends, without any proof, that foreign \u201ccommunist money\u201d turned the election against Mr. Trump. Such unsubstantiated claims have been repeated by niche online publications in Vietnamese, Chinese and other languages. \u201cThe crisis of democracy in the world makes people, especially activists, confused and susceptible to the influence of conspiracy theories and information manipulation,\u201d said Nguyen Quang A, a Vietnamese dissident who has been detained multiple times for his criticism of the country\u2019s communist leadership. \u201cVietnam doesn\u2019t have independent media, and people, especially activists, already hate mainstream media.\u201d One of the most influential voices spreading false narratives about Mr. Biden and the election on Twitter is Ai Weiwei, the Chinese contemporary artist who now lives in overseas exile. In an interview, Mr. Ai said that he was not a fan of Mr. Trump. For his art, he has posed at Trump properties with his middle finger raised. But Mr. Ai said that by shutting off debate on his social media feed, he would be no different than an authoritarian government like China\u2019s. \u201cAll over Asia, all over the world, people don\u2019t have the right to speak,\u201d he said. \u201cIn America, left or right, you have personal freedoms. This has to be protected.\u201d Chau Doan contributed reporting from Hanoi, Vietnam; Elaine Yu from Hong Kong; and Saw Nang from Yangon, Myanmar.",

    "article_text": "Biden Fractures Foot Playing With His Dog, Putting Him in a Boot President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. twisted his ankle playing with one of his dogs over the holiday weekend, an injury that his doctor said on Sunday resulted in hairline fractures in his foot that would most likely require him to wear a walking boot for several weeks. Although initial X-rays showed no obvious fracture, a \u201cfollow-up CT scan confirmed hairline (small) fractures of President-elect Biden\u2019s lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones, which are in the midfoot,\u201d Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor, the director of executive medicine at GW Medical Faculty Associates, said in a statement distributed by Mr. Biden\u2019s office. Mr. Biden visited an orthopedic specialist in Newark, Del., on Sunday afternoon for just over two hours, leaving just before 6:30 p.m. and going to an imaging center for a short time for the additional CT. A Biden spokesman said the president-elect had scheduled the follow-up on Sunday to avoid disrupting his schedule on Monday. A van was maneuvered to block reporters and photographers from seeing Mr. Biden as he entered the doctor\u2019s office. Mr. Biden, 78, is already operating on a crunched transition time frame, after the head of the General Services Administration did not formally acknowledge the presidential election results for weeks after Election Day, temporarily depriving Mr. Biden of access to federal resources and preventing his advisers from beginning coordination with Trump administration officials. President Trump, who has refused to concede to Mr. Biden, reposted on Twitter an NBC News video of Mr. Biden leaving the doctor\u2019s office on Sunday, and added, \u201cGet well soon!\u201d Mr. Biden slipped and injured himself Saturday while playing with Major, a German shepherd the Bidens had fostered that they then adopted in 2018. They have another German shepherd, Champ, and have announced plans to get a cat when they move into the White House next year, as well. Mr. Trump had no pet during his four years in the White House.",
