    "org_text": "Biden Faces a Balancing Act in Choosing Top Aides With Business Ties WASHINGTON \u2014 Five years ago, Jeffrey D. Zients was the head of the Obama administration\u2019s National Economic Council, working to push across the finish line a federal rule that would prevent financial advisers from taking advantage of retirees. He won praise from progressives for fending off fierce resistance from Wall Street and for fighting for consumer protections. These days, Mr. Zients is a co-chairman of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s transition team who is being watched warily by members of the Democratic Party\u2019s left wing. Progressive advocacy groups such as the Revolving Door Project and Justice Democrats, concerned that he would defend corporate America if given a top economic policy job in the Biden administration, pushed to keep him out of such a role. They view his recent work running an investment fund \u2014 Cranemere \u2014 and sitting on the board of Facebook as a detriment. The pre-emptive resistance to Mr. Zients (pronounced ZYE-ents) from the left is the latest indication of how the Democratic Party has shifted in the dozen years since former President Barack Obama took office amid the financial crisis. Now, business and finance experience can turn otherwise qualified White House candidates into pariahs for progressives. Mr. Zients, 54, has emerged as an important power center in the Biden transition team and was mentioned as a possible candidate to once again lead the National Economic Council or head the Office of Management and Budget, a role he held in an acting capacity during the Obama administration. With those jobs set to be filled by others, Mr. Zients is the front-runner, according to people familiar with the transition team\u2019s plans, to be the Biden administration\u2019s Covid czar, steering the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. In a sign of the pushback to come, the Revolving Door Project, which has been urging Mr. Biden to keep corporate influence out of his administration, has compiled a 13-page document about Mr. Zients. The file highlights his wealth, his appetite for deficit reduction during the Obama years and his recent work as chief executive of Cranemere. In the Obama administration, \u201chis role was essentially to be a management consultant for the executive branch: cutting costs, finding efficiencies and looking at things like a businessman,\u201d the Revolving Door document says. The group points to the majority stake that Cranemere took in NorthStar Anesthesia, a company that provides anesthesia services to hospitals and medical offices, in 2018. It cites negative reviews that NorthStar Anesthesia received through the Better Business Bureau, including allegations of surprise billing and a threat to send a dental patient\u2019s bill to a collection agency during a dispute over insurance coverage. That matter was resolved, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. A spokeswoman for NorthStar said that within two months of Cranemere\u2019s acquisition of the company, it had ended its practice of \u201cbalance billing\u201d \u2014 charging patients the difference between the cost of their services and what their insurers will pay. Jennifer Psaki, a spokeswoman for the Biden transition team, said Mr. Zients opposes surprise billing practices. \u201cJeff, like President-elect Biden, supports legislation to stop surprise billing by forcing the entire health care system to limit patient payments to in-network rates for all procedures and providers not preapproved by the patient,\u201d Ms. Psaki said. Progressives have been pushing the Biden transition team to install their preferred candidates in top roles and have been fairly supportive of some of Mr. Biden\u2019s early picks. These include Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, to be Treasury secretary; Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton University labor economist, to run the Council of Economic Advisers; and Neera Tanden, the chief executive of the Center for American Progress, to lead the Office of Management and Budget. But others are triggering a backlash, including Brian Deese, whom Mr. Biden has tapped to head the National Economic Council, and Adewale Adeyemo, the president-elect\u2019s choice for deputy Treasury secretary. Both men have worked at the asset management firm BlackRock, and many in the progressive wing view deep industry ties as a red flag. \u201cDemocrats should over all be alarmed by any Democratic administration considering filling the White House with Wall Street insiders and corporate lobbyists,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, spokesman for Justice Democrats, a political action committee. Early in his career, Mr. Zients worked as a consultant at Bain & Company before joining the Advisory Board Company, a health care research and consulting firm, where he rose to chief executive. He helped lead a spinoff of that business, which became the Corporate Executive Board, and both companies ultimately went public, in 1999 and 2001. According to Fortune, the Advisory Board\u2019s profitable initial public offering helped fuel Mr. Zients\u2019s net worth, which the magazine placed at nearly $150 million by 2002. In 2009, Mr. Zients joined the Office of Management and Budget as \u201cchief performance officer,\u201d rising to prominence within the Obama administration as a \u201cMr. Fix-It\u201d with strong operations skills and a knack for solving tough problems. Obama administration officials remember him for reviving the Affordable Care Act\u2019s website, HealthCare.gov, after glitches plagued its rollout. \u201cI call him the ultimate firefighter on these jobs,\u201d said Denis R. McDonough, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief of staff, who asked Mr. Zients to take on the project of fixing the website in 2013. \u201cHe runs into the burning buildings. He doesn\u2019t ask why. He doesn\u2019t ask when. He doesn\u2019t ask who\u2019s going with him.\u201d Later in Mr. Obama\u2019s second term, Mr. Zients led the National Economic Council, where he shepherded new regulations to crack down on payday lending and steered the development of the so-called fiduciary rule \u2014 a requirement that financial professionals put the interests of their customers with retirement accounts ahead of their own. The Labor Department rule, which the financial services and insurance industries strongly challenged, was struck down by a federal appeals court in 2018. Those efforts earned him accolades from some progressive Democrats. \u201cThe government needs talent and experience,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, the president of Better Markets, which promotes Wall Street reform, and a member of Mr. Biden\u2019s transition review team for the Fed, banking and securities regulators. \u201cPeople who are going to try to regulate an industry as complicated as finance can\u2019t say we\u2019re only going to hire people who know nothing about finance.\u201d But his role as a bridge to business during the Obama administration has raised some eyebrows. Mr. Zients was one of the administration\u2019s chief liaisons to executives and lobbyists when anger at Wall Street over the 2007-8 financial crisis was still at its peak. Top lobbyists such as the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have praised Mr. Zients as someone who heard them out. Describing his desire to listen to business leaders, Mr. Zients told executives at a 2014 event at the Economic Club of Washington, \u201cYou are the customers, all of you as business leaders, in terms of growing the economy.\u201d After Mr. Obama left office, Mr. Zients joined the private equity investor Vincent Mai\u2019s Cranemere fund as chief executive. The private holding company has investors from United States, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East and takes a long-term investing approach in the mold of Warren E. Buffett. Mr. Zients, who is on leave from Cranemere, also spent two years on the board of Facebook and was a member of the company\u2019s audit committee. He has told people that he had concerns about the company\u2019s direction and governance, and opted not to seek re-election to the board this year. Facebook has come under fire from Democrats for allowing the spread of disinformation and from Republicans who accuse it of censorship. Jeff Hauser, the director of the Revolving Door Project, said Mr. Zients\u2019s experience working in private equity and at Facebook was particularly problematic and could portend trouble for progressive causes in a Biden White House. And while he sees Mr. Zients\u2019s experience in the health care industry as useful for managing the pandemic response, Mr. Hauser said he was concerned that Mr. Zients could be too accommodating to business as vaccines are rolled out next year. \u201cDissemination and delivery of the vaccine will be a significant undertaking,\u201d Mr. Hauser said. He added that Mr. Zients understood how to do it, \u201cbut whether or not he would be too sympathetic to businesses in management of that power is to be determined.\u201d In a role directing the virus response, which will require coordination across government agencies and the private sector, corporate management experience could be an asset. Fred P. Hochberg, who was president of the U.S. Export-Import Bank from 2009-17, said that ideological labels evolved over time and that business experience should not be a blemish. \u201cI think Jeff is certainly progressive, but there\u2019s a pragmatism, a \u2018what can we get done to move things forward?\u2019\u201d Mr. Hochberg said. \u201cIn government, it\u2019s about accomplishing things. It\u2019s not just about making a statement.\u201d"

    "org_text": "Joe Biden should do everything at once Joe Biden will become the US president during an extraordinary moment in history, one that could very well prove to be the calm before the storm, a brief prelude to dissolution and illiberalism. Trump\u2019s bid to become a full-on authoritarian failed, but Democrats could easily lose the House in a 2022 backlash. Biden could face total congressional opposition, even impeachment \u2014 as the recent baseless \u201cstolen election\u201d narrative has shown, if Republicans don\u2019t have any evidence, they\u2019ll just make something up.  Or maybe Democrats will keep the House and take the Senate in 2022, and legislation will become possible! Who knows? (The Georgia Senate runoffs are another big question mark.) If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned over the past five years, it\u2019s that I definitely don\u2019t know what is going to happen next, and it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone else does either. What we do know is that Republicans will wage full-on war on Biden from the second he takes office. They will generate fake conspiracies and controversies through right-wing media and social media. Conservative voters will be told again and again that Biden and Kamala Harris are uniquely dangerous traitors engaged in all sorts of elaborate evil plots. The entire conservative movement, from top to bottom, will view limiting Biden to one term as its primary strategic objective. And the movement will engage in misinformation, norm violation, procedural fuckery, and outright lawbreaking, if necessary, to achieve that objective.  The right will be what it is, what it has been becoming for decades now; expecting anything else would be madness. The question is how the Biden administration should behave, knowing all this. It would be foolish for anyone to claim to have all the answers, or any of the answers really, but in my mind the most pointed lesson about how to behave in a hopelessly partisan environment comes from Donald Trump himself. Before getting to that (suspense!), it\u2019s instructive to take a look back at some of the experiences of the administration for which Biden was vice president. When Barack Obama took office in 2009 in a deepening recession, he expected to receive some Republican help bailing out the economy. It\u2019s easy today to look back on that expectation as naive, but at the time it wasn\u2019t unreasonable. The economy was on the brink of disaster, the need was clear, and the depth of conservative backlash was not yet as evident as it would become later.  What happened instead was a wall of opposition from Republicans, built on bad-faith objections about deficit spending and government waste. With so little room to maneuver, Democrats were forced to negotiate with the tiny handful of moderate Republicans and the large handful of conservative Democrats in the Senate, holding the stimulus bill down to their arbitrary spending caps. In the end, the stimulus bill passed with zero Republican votes in the House and just three in the Senate. The result was an inadequate economic boost and a sluggish recovery that hobbled the rest of Obama\u2019s presidency. Since it was widely agreed that \u201cpolitical capital\u201d was limited and Democrats could only take on one fight at a time, the question then became what to tackle next. The answer proved to be health care reform, perceived as a policy better developed and more widely supported in the Democratic caucus.  In July 2009, Democrats in the House introduced a health care plan based on a system that had been road-tested by Mitt Romney in his recent tenure as governor in Massachusetts. Many Democrats thought the process would take a few months, and then Congress could move on to climate change. Instead, again and again, Republicans lured Democrats into extended negotiations, only to withdraw support at the last minute over some new bad-faith objection (see: \u201cdeath panels\u201d). That left Democrats negotiating with their most conservative members, who did much the same thing (Joe Lieberman, may his name live in infamy). In the end, talks dragged on until March 2010, when Obama finally signed the Affordable Care Act. It got no Republican votes, in the Senate or the House.  Then it was finally time for climate change, and the strategy there was yet more clever sequencing. Obama told Republicans that if they didn\u2019t cooperate on climate change legislation, he would regulate greenhouse gases via the Environmental Protection Agency, which would offer less flexibility and less ability to compensate hard-hit communities. The idea was that the threat of EPA regulations \u2014 made inevitable by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA judgment that carbon dioxide is a pollutant subject to the Clean Air Act \u2014 would frighten Republicans to the legislative table, where they could better defend their interests.  Instead, Republicans vowed implacable opposition to all of it. They would fight furiously against legislation when it was on the table and then fight regulations just as furiously when they came up. To a cool Vulcan mind like Obama\u2019s, it seemed entirely irrational, against Republicans\u2019 own best interests. At that point, he had not fully internalized the extent to which the conservative movement has become unleashed id, driven more by right-wing media than by Republican politicians, fueled by resentment and organized purely to defeat the libs.  In June 2009, when the climate bill passed the House, it got eight Republican votes. By mid-2010, it was dead in the water, with no hope of any Republican votes in the Senate. Democrats no longer had their filibuster-proof 60 seats, and there was nothing like the same support in the caucus that health care reform generated, so it never came to a Senate vote. It ended with a whimper, not a bang. As promised, Obama\u2019s EPA began slowly rolling out regulations, one at a time. It wasn\u2019t until late in his first term that auto mileage standards were finalized and into his second term before EPA got to power plants. Republicans were able to keep Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan tied up in court through the end of his second term. Then Trump took power and began a simultaneous all-fronts assault on Obama\u2019s regulations, unrolling them so fast it was difficult to even keep track. The theme of these stories is that Democrats relied on clever sequencing over and over again, imagining some amount of political capital (\u201ccredibility\u201d) that they could husband and spend strategically to get assistance across the aisle, at every juncture underestimating the ferocity and unanimity of Republican opposition. They kept behaving as though they would find good-faith negotiating partners, as though they were still in the postwar American era of relatively low (or at least manageable) polarization.  What too few of them realized was that they were already in a new era of near-total polarization, with the population sorted into like-minded enclaves, a bifurcated media ecosystem nurturing stacked (and diametrically opposed) \u201cmega-identities,\u201d and voters motivated primarily by \u201cnegative partisanship,\u201d which is to say, hatred of the other side.  A fully polarized two-party system really is a zero-sum game. Any victories or gains by one side come at the other side\u2019s expense, even if the victory secures shared goals. The rational course for the party out of power is to fight with full intensity against everything, always, and that\u2019s what Republicans did under Obama. With scarcely any exceptions, from 2010 through 2020, they pushed in every case for maximal partisan advantage, no matter the stakes or possible cost.  The GOP has failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite a few close calls, but otherwise, its unprincipled pursuit of raw power has paid off handsomely. The party captured state legislatures in 2010 and was able to gerrymander itself minority rule in several states. It practically shut down Congress as a legislative body for six years of Obama\u2019s term. It blocked Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court and for its efforts got Neil Gorsuch. It ignored Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s dying wishes and for its efforts got a 6-3 conservative Court majority that could last for generations.  Republicans blocked so many Democratic judicial nominations that Senate leader Harry Reid had to get rid of the judicial filibuster to keep the courts staffed. Then, when the GOP took control of the presidency and Senate, it used the absence of the filibuster to pack the federal courts full of hyper-ideological, young, often woefully unqualified judges. Rather than paying any price for total partisan warfare, Republicans were rewarded in 2016 with the presidency and both houses of Congress. After carrying the country to the brink of authoritarian crisis, it has now lost the House and the presidency. But Joe Biden has been left to tackle a virtually uncontrolled pandemic and millions of people out of work and on the verge of homelessness or food insecurity.  The GOP will likely retain control of the Senate, which means there will be no adequate economic recovery package and none of Biden\u2019s ambitious campaign plans will come to fruition. It has kept control of key state legislatures, so it will be able to gerrymander itself an advantage for another decade. The elections of 2022 will be another partisan brawl, and the odds are stacked against Democrats; the president\u2019s party has lost seats in every first-term midterm in the past 100 years, save three. If Republicans gain full control of Congress, impeachment becomes a real possibility, even if conviction is very unlikely. It\u2019s a grim situation, and Biden is starting out behind the eight-ball. How should he proceed? Here we return to the lesson that Trump has to teach Biden about life in hyperpolarized politics.  To wit: blitz. Do everything at once. No matter what the Biden administration does, it will be accused of socialism and corruption by the right. And the past several years have richly demonstrated that conservative parts of the country, particularly rural areas and low-density suburbs, are almost completely captured by right-wing media, from Fox on the TV to AM conservative radio to Sinclair-owned local news to the profusion of shady Facebook sources and groups, where misinformation is rapid and rampant.  Democrats badly need to address this media asymmetry. Despite what conservatives have convinced themselves, mainstream media outlets like CNN are not analogous to Fox, and Democrats have no comparable radio, local TV, or social media operations to carry their messages and narratives straight to voters where they live.  But that is long-term work, and 2022 is right around the corner.  The only thing Biden will have real control over is his administration and what it does. And his North Star, his organizing principle, should be doing as much good on as many fronts as fast as possible. Blitz. By constantly blundering forward, Trump has helped chart which US institutions and norms provide real resistance and which don\u2019t. The courts have tangibly restrained Trump; they have been the primary bulwark against him. But the chattering of the media and the political classes? Moral outrage? Precedent and tradition? Civil protest?  All of these have proven gossamer. Trump charged right through them like they were cotton candy. By constantly acting, being on the offensive, generating new stories and controversies, he simply overwhelmed the ability of the system to fasten on any one thing.  Biden should learn the lesson. All that matters is what gets done, put on paper and into law. The rest is vapor. The administration should staff up as rapidly as possible with ambitious young progressives and tell every single civil servant that the next two years are going to be a full sprint. Start immediately rewriting and reimplementing the environmental, public health, and worker safety regulations Trump has weakened. Reverse his immigration policies. Drop his lawsuits.  Reassess the social cost of carbon. Replace Trump\u2019s weak Affordable Clean Energy rule with more stringent carbon rules for the power sector. Ditch EPA\u2019s \u201csecret science\u201d rule and restock scientific advisory boards with actual scientists. Put a moratorium on new oil and gas drilling leases on public land. Pledge the purchasing power of the federal government \u2014 around $500 billion a year \u2014 toward clean energy technology.  Through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), direct federal financing toward carbon reduction and clean energy across agencies. Use the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to reject regulations from any agency that do not include both a climate and equity \u201cscreen\u201d to ensure that they reduce emissions and help the most vulnerable. Use the powers conferred by the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill to integrate climate risks into the financial system.  I\u2019ve written more about what Biden can do on climate change without Congress. Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews took a wider policy view with 10 big things Biden can do with executive powers, from forgiving student loan debt to reigning in factory farming. More ideas can be found here, here, here, and here, among other places. There\u2019s no shortage of ways for Biden to deploy the powers of the presidency, and he should maximize every one of them. All of these moves will elicit howls of outrage and court challenges from the right. Many will also infuriate the left, since they will inevitably fall short of Biden\u2019s grand campaign promises.  Biden can\u2019t control any of that. Doing less, negotiating more, relying on clever sequencing, chasing after receding promises of cooperation \u2014 none of that will solve anything, any more than it did for Obama. He can reach across the aisle, make it clear his door is open, but he shouldn\u2019t wait around for anyone to walk in. Biden\u2019s best chance is to try to overwhelm the system the way Trump did, by doing so much that it\u2019s impossible to make any one thing into a lasting story. He should launch so many simultaneous reforms that there\u2019s no time for right-wing media to make up lies about all of them or for the Supreme Court to hear them all. He should ignore bad-faith attacks and stay relentlessly on message about what\u2019s gotten done and what\u2019s getting done next. He should, at every juncture, get caught trying to make government work better for ordinary people. To succeed, all this must happen alongside Democratic Party efforts to improve messaging and media, get persistent party infrastructure on the ground in communities the party has neglected, and innovate on voter outreach and persuasion. (Aaron Strauss has some good ideas on that front.) But Biden has something the rest of the party at the federal level does not have: the power to improve Americans\u2019 lives in a visible way. More than anything else, cynicism about government\u2019s ability to do that is corroding US politics. The best thing Biden can do, morally and politically, is act, as much and as fast as possible, and then talk about it, and do more of it, and talk about it more. (And he should be clear about exactly who stands in the way of bigger, better changes, and why his name is Mitch McConnell.) The rest of it, he should ignore: the Washington chatter about the latest Republican accusations or catty infighting among Democratic factions, the cable news story or Twitter drama of the day, the latest offensive thing Trump or some Trump surrogate said, all of it. Bulldoze through it. The president has limited ability to control political discourse and drama, but he has an enormous capacity to change policy and direct resources. Biden should use that power while he has it, without hesitation or apology."
