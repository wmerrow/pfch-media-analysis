    "article_text": "SNL\u2019s cold open spoofs Rudy Giuliani\u2019s absurd Michigan hearing In its December 5 cold open, Saturday Night Live parodied the testimony of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s roster of witnesses at a widely-panned hearing before Michigan lawmakers last week, in which President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer tried to convince legislators to overturn the state\u2019s election results. The sketch sought to mock the way in which many of the witnesses, in real life, rehashed baseless claims of voter fraud and misconduct, and on one particularly notable occasion, became adversarial toward the Michigan lawmakers overseeing the hearing while floating conspiracy theories. Kate McKinnon, playing a theatrical and bumbling Giuliani, opened the hearing by declaring, \u201cThis election was stolen from the American people with a level of trickery not seen since Houdini.\u201d When asked for evidence of his claims, McKinnon\u2019s Giuliani went on: \u201cI have brought before you a dozen highly intelligent, barely intoxicated individuals who are all eyewitnesses, and after hearing their testimony you\u2019re going to say, \u2018Wow, Rudy was right, and he\u2019s getting smarter and more respected every day.\u2019\u201d The first witness to offer their testimony was Cecily Strong playing Melissa Carone \u2014 a contract information technology worker for a voting systems company \u2014 who, in real life, made sweeping, evidence-free allegations about fraud at the hearing. \u201cI personally saw hundreds, if not thousands, of dead people vote for Democrats,\u201d Strong\u2019s Carone stated. \u201cDid you check every poll? Did you talk to all the dead people?\u201d  Heidi Gardner played another eyewitness, who claimed she saw Democrats serving ballots from food trucks. \u201cThe Democrats said, \u2018It\u2019s lunch time\u2019 and then they opened the food truck and it was full \u2014 full of ballot sandwiches, ballot pizzas, ballot steaks, and ballot spaghetti,\u201d she said.  Gardner\u2019s testimony seems to be an allusion to the real-life Carone\u2019s insinuations in an interview with Fox News\u2019s Lou Dobbs that venders providing food to poll workers were carrying fraudulent votes. Beck Bennett played My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell, a Trump ally who has made numerous implausible claims about voter fraud in recent weeks, and who, in SNL\u2019s version of events, used his testimony as a thinly veiled advertisement for his company. Alex Moffat played a witness who described an alien abduction story and then clarified that he saw the aliens \u201cclearly filling out absentee ballots, all of them for Biden.\u201d Asked when it happened, he said it was \u201cseven years ago.\u201d There was also an appearance by Pete Davidson and Kyle Mooney playing two of the 14 men accused of a militia plot which included kidnapping Michigan\u2019s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, saying that they needed a chance \u201cto do the whole thing over again.\u201d \u201cIf we have one more shot, we can get her in my basement for sure!\u201d Davidson shouted. McKinnon\u2019s Giuliani wrapped up the hearing with a nod to the personal interests of those involved with keeping up Trump\u2019s quixotic legal efforts to contest the election results: \u201cThe defense rests, but we will never rest, not until this election is overturned, or unless I get a full pardon or $10 million in cash.\u201d    ",

    "article_text": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s bizarre legal strategy, in two clips  \u201cWhat\u2019d you guys do \u2014 take it and do something crazy to it?\u201d That\u2019s just one of many absurd claims in a clip that has reached more than 13 million views already, where Melissa Carone \u2014 one of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s star witnesses at a hearing where he asked Michigan legislators to overturn the state\u2019s presidential election results \u2014 veers from accusation to accusation. In a testy exchange, Carone accuses Republican state representatives of tampering with state voting records when one official tells her the poll book is not off by 30,000 votes.  The exchange is comically hard to follow, but it\u2019s illustrative of the sputtering, slapdash, and conspiracy theory-driven nature of Trumpworld\u2019s flailing attempts to discredit and overturn the results of the 2020 election. Carone\u2019s testimony was part of a hearing scheduled on December 1 when Michigan House Oversight Chair Matt Hall (R) invited Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to \u201cspeak to the committee on election irregularities in Michigan.\u201d Hall said in his statement that he was hoping for \u201cclarity and transparency.\u201d  That\u2019s not what Michigan got.  According to MLive, the Trump legal team mostly spent their time calling up Michigan Republicans to testify against the election process in Wayne County. Many of them rehashed baseless claims of voter fraud and misconduct \u201cmade at a Senate Oversight Committee hearing Tuesday and in affidavits included in various legal challenges to the election results ... none of those challenges have been successful in court.\u201d This hearing came two days after Attorney General Bill Barr told the Associated Press that there was no proof that widespread voter fraud could have altered the result of the 2020 presidential election. Michigan Republicans did not allow testimony under oath, restricted Democrats from calling witnesses, and prohibited cross-examination, leading Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to call the hearings a \u201cstate sponsored disinformation campaign geared toward undermining our electoral system.\u201d Carone\u2019s testimony was, if not emblematic, at least fairly in step with the rest of the hearing. Her testimony went too far for even Giuliani, who at one point leaned over, seemingly to try to restrain his witness after she laughed derisively at a request to stop interrupting the official asking her to clarify her claims of fraud. It\u2019s unclear what Giuliani expected \u2014 Carone\u2019s accusations had been aired on Fox when she was interviewed on November 11. In the interview with Lou Dobbs, she insinuated that vans providing food to poll workers were in fact carrying illegitimate votes instead. Days later, a Wayne County judge stated that these allegations \u201csimply are not credible,\u201d according to reporting by the Washington Post.  Multiple witnesses focused their criticisms on Detroit, a city that is 79 percent Black and that Giuliani referred to as \u201ccorrupt,\u201d saying \u201cdon\u2019t scratch your head about what happens in Detroit. They steal elections in Detroit.\u201d  MLive reported that Detroit activists have been alarmed by the Trump campaign\u2019s claims of voter fraud in their city. Activist Branden Snyder told MLive that it \u201creeks of racism ... that Black folks and in a majority-Black city can\u2019t count their own votes.\u201d Nessel echoed these claims, saying \u201cthe themes we see, that persist here, are this: Black people are corrupt, Black people are incompetent, and Black people can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, one Michigan woman used racist language to argue in favor of instituting a voter ID requirement.  Accusations of voter fraud are inextricable from the long history of restricting the right of people of color to vote. A January brief published by the Brennan Center for Justice explains: Of course, Michigan does have a voter ID requirement. You have to present a valid form of identification or sign an affidavit. In the November 2016 election, only around 18,000 people opted to sign an affidavit instead of providing identification, according to Bridge Michigan, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news source. President-elect Joe Biden received over 150,000 more votes than Trump in the state.  One Republican official\u2019s reaction to the hearing pretty much sums it up \u2014 state Rep. Aaron Miller castigated Giuliani, telling the Detroit News: \u201cHe made wild and broad partisan insults for several minutes that had nothing to do with the election, and it was frankly unacceptable, shameful, and pathetic and distracts from any evidence that we might hear. I\u2019m utterly embarrassed.\u201d ",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the election result has sputtered out President Donald Trump still has not conceded his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden, but his bid to overturn the election results has sputtered out over the past week. The lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors. Trump is still, of course, trying his best to cast doubt on the results by making false claims of large-scale voter fraud. His latest gimmick is that his legal team is working with sympathetic Republican legislators in key states to hold press events touting supposed election irregularities. But no GOP-controlled legislature in a state Biden won seems to be making a serious push to overturn the result (a move that would entail many practical and legal obstacles). But the deadline in federal law for states to finalize their results is December 8 \u2014 Tuesday of next week. Then, the members of the Electoral College will meet (separately in each state) to cast their votes on December 14 \u2014 in just under two weeks. They are set to cast the votes that will officially make Biden the next president. And Trump has not yet been able to succeed in interfering with that process. There were six key swing states where Biden won by small margins, where Trump had hoped to interfere with the certification of results (certification is when a state makes its results official). Four of those six states \u2014 Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada \u2014 certified their results over the past week and a half, with Biden as the winner. The fifth and sixth, Arizona and Wisconsin, certified Biden\u2019s victory on Monday. Trump made political, procedural, and legal attempts to try and delay or interfere with these certifications, but these efforts have uniformly failed. Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, spurned the Trump team\u2019s attempts to get him to endorse fictitious claims of widespread voter fraud in the state. In Michigan, Trump allies\u2019 attempts to get two Republicans on the state board of canvassers to  block certification for similar reasons failed last week (one of them backed it).  In most of the other states, the key officials in charge of certifying results were Democrats, so Trump could only hope that a judge would step in and block certification. None have \u2014 so the Trump team\u2019s lawsuits flopped. Recounts have also failed to change the outcome. Wisconsin\u2019s recount of two counties has concluded, and Biden\u2019s lead of about 20,000 votes expanded by 87 votes. Georgia\u2019s new machine recount is still ongoing, but it isn\u2019t expected to change Biden\u2019s 12,000-vote lead since the ballots have already been audited by hand. After states certify their results, the next step in the process is that the electors are appointed. And this is key \u2014 the electors are the 538 people who compose the Electoral College and cast the votes that will officially determine the next president.  If Biden wins a state, he is entitled to have his chosen slate of people appointed as the electors for that state. But some Republicans have embraced the theory that the Constitution empowers state legislatures to ignore the outcome of the vote in their states and appoint whoever they want as electors instead.  Any effort to do this would run afoul of various state laws and arguably federal law as well. Legislators would essentially be asserting that the power granted them by the Constitution allows them to ignore these existing laws.  Some GOP state legislators have indeed come out in support of this, such as Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano (who met with Trump last week before abruptly leaving the meeting after he was informed he had tested positive for Covid-19). But GOP state legislative leaders have not come out in support of this effort, and most have outright said they won\u2019t. Pennsylvania\u2019s legislative leaders have no plans to put this on their legislative agenda. And Michigan\u2019s Republican leaders left a meeting with Trump earlier this month and said they would \u201cfollow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan\u2019s electors.\u201d And even though Trump\u2019s legal team worked with allied legislators in Pennsylvania and Arizona to hold purported \u201chearings\u201d about election irregularities in recent days, those weren\u2019t official legislative hearings \u2014 they were essentially press stunts.  So with neither the officials in charge of certifications nor Republican state legislative leaders willing to try to steal the election for Trump, it looks like the president\u2019s attempt to do just that is dead in the water.

    "article_text": "What happened to Democrats in North Carolina: \u201cIt was a total effort that failed down ballot\u201d North Carolina Democrats and progressive organizers this year had hoped for a repeat of the 2008 election, when Democrats won in the state up and down the ballot. Instead, they saw several victories for Republicans. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win the presidency,\u201d said Robert Dawkins, the political director of Action NC, an advocacy group focused on anti-poverty initiatives and voter outreach. \u201cWe didn\u2019t gain any progressive seats in the House, state Senate; most of the black candidates that ran for judges didn\u2019t win. It was a total effort that failed down ballot.\u201d Ahead of Election Day, polls projected positive results for Democrats in North Carolina \u2014 on November 3, President-elect Joe Biden led President Donald Trump in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s state polling average by 1.8 percentage points, Democratic US Senate candidate Cal Cunningham led incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis by anywhere from 2 to 6 percentage points, and incumbent Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper was regularly recorded as having double-digit support. Of the three, only Cooper won, and by 4.52 percentage points. Biden lost by 1.34 percentage points, Cunningham by 1.74 percentage points, and Republicans maintained control of the state legislature. The losses for Democrats weren\u2019t due to low turnout; in fact, turnout was up, with 75 percent of eligible voters \u2014 5.54 million people \u2014 casting ballots. According to the North Carolina state board of elections, Democrats expanded their voter base by nearly 500,000 compared to 2016, while Republicans gained about 400,000 more voters. And a Carolina Population Center analysis found about 1.8 million new voters (Democratic, Republican, and unaffiliated) registered compared to 2016. There was expanded access to polling sites, with early voting locations being added in cities and efforts to facilitate transportation for those lacking it on Election Day. A number of activists told me there were fewer instances of outright voter suppression than had been feared, and that wait times to cast ballots generally weren\u2019t long.  None of that was enough, however. Many I spoke to in the state said they believe the results showed the problem was not about enthusiasm or turnout, but about strategy, difficulty overcoming the consequences of past elections, and, most importantly, timing.  Unlike North Carolina, Biden was able to win in Georgia, defeating Trump by 0.25 percentage points. According to activists and organizers in North Carolina, the difference between the two states was at least partly self-inflicted. Take Democrats\u2019 outreach strategy in each state: Dawkins said Georgia deftly implemented a policy-centric approach that could have been employed more effectively in North Carolina. \u201cIn Georgia, from the start of the new year in January, everything, every campaign, if they were talking about why a neighborhood needs a speed bump, it was, \u2018It\u2019s not going to change until you register to vote. And here\u2019s a card, register to vote,\u2019\u201d Dawkins said. \u201cIt was surgical.\u201d A similar strategy led to Democrats\u2019 last big win in North Carolina in 2008, according to Dawkins. That year, the Democratic Party won the presidency, a US Senate race, the governor\u2019s chair, and maintained control of the state\u2019s General Assembly.  Dawkins said that year, \u201cI don\u2019t care if we\u2019re talking about a pothole, or I don\u2019t care if we\u2019re talking about the light rail here, or whatever it was, got tied to, \u2018And we need to vote to get this man in office.\u2019\u201d That year, Barack Obama was on the ballot, and this method of winning votes was made easier by the enthusiasm created by his candidacy. This time, voters weren\u2019t quite as animated by their choices.  Ahead of the election, Kevin Jones, the first vice chair of the Nash County Democratic Party, told me he was concerned about the level of enthusiasm for the Democrats on the ballot, particularly Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf Donald Trump needs 15 electoral votes to win the presidency and it comes down to one vote in North Carolina, it won\u2019t be my vote that gets him in there. But, you know, I don\u2019t feel too good about it.\u201d But there remains a sense that a different strategy could have overcome that gap. Obama wasn\u2019t on the ballot in Georgia this year either, and the state nevertheless flipped blue for the first time in nearly 30 years. Bennett Carpenter, the lead organizer for the progressive political group Durham for All, said his organization worked to highlight how Democratic policies would help voters \u2014 and saw success with it.  \u201cPeople are so clear, especially in this moment, on the issues facing our communities, they\u2019re loud and obvious,\u201d Carpenter said. Acknowledging that many in their community are frustrated with a lack of progress on those issues, Carpenter added that Durham for All saw success in \u201csharing messaging around, \u2018We can make change happen, we can work together\u2019 ... it\u2019s a bridge to bring people over kind of the arc from disillusionment to hope and possibility.\u201d  But Dawkins believes it should have been executed more broadly. Marcus Bass, the executive director of Advance Carolina, a progressive advocacy group focused on empowering Black communities, said he saw the problem as coming from the top. He believes that the national Democratic Party\u2019s \u201coffering of the Trump-or-else ticket, without really providing a deep response to some of these longstanding issues, hurt the efforts of turnout in North Carolina.\u201d  And Todd Zimmer, co-director of the rural progressive advocacy group Down Home North Carolina, noted that Democrats\u2019 single statewide success, the reelection of Gov. Roy Cooper, can be seen as a testament to the effectiveness of a policy-centric approach.  \u201cCooper has shown that he will fight for Medicaid expansion, that he\u2019ll stand up, even if he can\u2019t win that fight with a divided General Assembly,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI think he was rewarded by North Carolina voters because he\u2019s seen as someone who understands how important that issue is ... [and] his response also surely helped. Because North Carolinians approve of his handling of the coronavirus and oppose the reopen movement, by and large.\u201d A number of organizers also said Democrats hurt themselves. Organizers in many swing states have complained post-election that the Democratic Party relied too heavily on consultants and operatives from outside their states \u2014 and I heard similar lamentations about the national party\u2019s strategy in North Carolina.  Bass argued party leaders miscalculated in hoping the top of the ticket would buoy down-ballot candidates. And while national leaders were generally given credit for investing in the state, North Carolina organizers said that money was often not used wisely and that staff and consultants arrived too late in the year, with too little understanding of the communities they\u2019d been embedded in to do much good.  The issue, they said, and as Florida state Sen. Annette Taddeo told Politico, is that \u201cyou can\u2019t just show up a month before the election and expect people to be excited to vote for you.\u201d  Perhaps the most important issue was one of time, according to many organizers. They said flipping North Carolina can and will happen, once they\u2019ve had a few more years to do so. Durham for All was limited in part by being a relatively new organization, Carpenter said \u2014 it was founded only four years ago. Down Home North Carolina is about three years old. And many of the progressive organizations they partner with are around the same age or newer. \u201cIn the places where we\u2019re really building that infrastructure, I think we\u2019re seeing real gains,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cA lesson to me is that that infrastructure takes time and resources and permanent year-round work.\u201d Carpenter said the hope is that in four years, with continued work and engagement, the results of North Carolina\u2019s elections will be radically different. And in Georgia, organizers told me that time \u2014 coupled with consistent work \u2014 was the secret to their success. Deborah Scott, the executive director of Georgia Stand-Up told Vox\u2019s Anna North that turning Georgia blue was a 15-year effort.  As Lewanna Heard-Tucker, chair of Georgia\u2019s Fulton County Democrats, told me, \u201cAt the end of the day, this has been a long time coming for Georgia. It didn\u2019t just happen overnight.\u201d While there are certainly opportunities Democrats and organizers can continue to pursue, their efforts were also complicated by factors outside of their control. Chief among these was the coronavirus pandemic, which forced organizers and party officials to scrap their plans for registration and motivation and to hastily come up with new strategies.  \u201cRight when we started [outreach efforts] Covid hit, which threw a wrench in some of our plans, particularly because our initial plan had been really focused on door-knocking as the way that you can really meet people where they\u2019re at and build relationships,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cAnd so right from jump, we had to really switch to primarily phone-banking and text-banking and from in-person events to virtual.\u201d For Durham for All, those efforts were more effective than they might have hoped. And Bass noted that while the pandemic made organizing difficult, it allowed Advance Carolina to engage in ways it might not otherwise have been able to. \u201cTaking us out of physical spaces,\u201d said Bass, \u201chelped build a broader base, in some cases, where groups that typically would just be meeting in private spaces now are online.\u201d But for other organizations, the transition was more difficult. Zimmer said Down Home North Carolina moved to a \u201crelational turnout model\u201d where about 800 leaders were given access to an app to help support them in outreach to friends, family, and others they had personal relationships with. The organization also moved an outreach strategy based around conversations on race and class it had planned to use in person to the phones.  \u201cI think that was to our disadvantage, frankly,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI think that those tactics are powerful and strong, but that doors is a really important part of our electoral process. And so I wish we could have a do-over and could be on doors.\u201d And Dawkins noted that many other organizations struggled as they \u201cdrastically moved off of a tried-and-true and proven method of door contact and phone-banking and switched over to more mobile mobilization work, which I don\u2019t think paid off.\u201d Much of that mobile mobilization work consisted of \u201cwhat we call souls to the polls,\u201d Dawkins said \u2014 meaning organizations worked with pastors and other community leaders to put together marches to polling places. \u201cThat drastically hurt,\u201d Dawkins told me, \u201cbecause what you found was the people that were showing up and taking part in these marches to the polls and souls to the polls were people that were already gonna vote.\u201d Because of pandemic- and funding-related challenges, Action NC was ultimately not able to match its normal level of voter engagement. \u201cNormally we shoot to register between 15,000 and 20,000 people a year. This year, we reregistered 6,500. So that was a big hit,\u201d Dawkins said. Still, statewide, registration was up, buoyed in part by the state\u2019s nearly 400,000 new residents since 2016. Turnout increased dramatically as well. In the rural communities Down Home North Carolina serves, Zimmer said, \u201cin a lot of cases [there was] an over 100 percent increase versus \u201916.\u201d Overall, Carpenter said, \u201cWe brought 100,000 more folks into the races than the right wing did, which meant that when it comes to statewide races, we were able to really narrow the gap \u2014 but still not close it.\u201d Closing that gap was complicated in part by the past. While Democrats won resoundingly in 2008, they lost badly in 2010, when Republicans took control of the North Carolina\u2019s General Assembly. These lawmakers oversaw redistricting after the 2010 census, redrawing maps to benefit the GOP \u2014 first along racial lines and then along partisan lines after their initial effort was invalidated by the US Supreme Court for diluting the voting power of Black North Carolinians. In 2012, a Republican governor won, giving the GOP complete control of the state. New voting constraints, including a voter ID law, followed in 2013. These were struck down in 2016 by the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals for targeting \u201cAfrican Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d A modified version of the voter ID law was then instated via ballot measure in 2018. It\u2019s currently being fought in court \u2014 and as a result, was not in effect for the 2020 election. Nevertheless, this reality made it feel as though Democrats and organizers for progressive causes were playing against a stacked deck, their voting power diluted and many citizens unsure of whether they had the documents needed to vote. Carpenter said it \u201cfor sure\u201d hurt Democrats in the most recent election.  Many organizers, like Carpenter, see the 2020 election as the catalyst for greater change in the state and the start of years of organizing work and court battles in order to make North Carolina more competitive for Democrats. Legal challenges to the state\u2019s voter ID law are set to continue in state and federal court \u2014 and advocates hope to lobby for greater access to voter registration. For example, online voter registration was made available this cycle for North Carolinians with driver\u2019s licenses, a policy change Carpenter called \u201can improvement that still didn\u2019t fully address the structural barriers that prevent particularly people of color, poor working-class people, and young people from registering and voting.\u201d Expanding that access would make registering new voters easier ahead of the 2022 races. Carpenter also spoke of working to expand Democrats\u2019 voter base. Biden was clearly able to grow his base of support in historically Democratic counties but struggled more to flip back Obama-voting counties Trump won in 2016. In many of those, Trump built upon his 2016 vote totals; for example, in Robeson County, which Trump swung by 21 percentage points in 2016, he beat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by 4 percentage points. In 2020, he defeated Biden there by 18.6 percentage points. \u201cIf I have a takeaway from this election, it\u2019s that we need to continue to do work to persuade people who might be voting for Trump that actually, our politics offers them a better path towards a more hopeful and prosperous and happier future,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI think we need to have the audacity to believe that our vision can be more powerful and more compelling than the siren call of white supremacy.\u201d Perhaps the most immediately pressing issue for organizers and Democrats will be the fact that the GOP will retain control of the General Assembly.  When the new districts are drawn following the release of the 2020 census results, Republican lawmakers are likely to attempt to neutralize Democratic power in places where Biden significantly increased his vote share over Clinton, like Wake County, and to minimize the role new Democratic state residents have on elections. Dawkins said he and other activists expect to \u201cgo back to court and fight over that.\u201d  That means in the short term, organizers and local Democratic officials need to play where they can win, Carpenter said, adding that the key question is, \u201cHow can we actually be mobilizing for real change in the places where we do have decisive governing power as we\u2019re continuing to build that grassroots infrastructure at the local level?\u201d And in the long term, Zimmer said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conversations happening in some of the spaces I\u2019m in right now about 10-year strategies because there\u2019s a sense that North Carolina will change but that we have to organize and build strategically in order to get there.\u201d For many I spoke to, that strategic building will involve outreach, education, pooling resources with like-minded organizations, and the careful recruitment of candidates that reflect the communities they are running in and that have a nuanced grasp of policy.  The ultimate goal, Carpenter said, is to be in a position \u201cfour years from now, eight years from now, where we\u2019re continuing to grow the movement, grow the leaders, grow the infrastructure that can not just win one election, but actually continue to win real change for North Carolina.\u201d ",
