    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s legal team advances yet another far-fetched lawsuit in Georgia President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has filed yet another lawsuit contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, this time calling for a complete do-over of the election in Georgia. That\u2019s despite two recounts in the state \u2014 overseen by Republican officials \u2014 both indicating Biden\u2019s victory in the state is unambiguous and not going to change. Trump\u2019s new lawsuit, filed in a Georgia state court on Friday, represents the latest of dozens of efforts by his campaign and its allies to contest the legitimacy of vote counts in key states across the nation, all of which have failed to gain traction \u2014 or even be taken seriously by judges \u2014 with the exception of one minor win involving an insignificant number of ballots. But while Trump\u2019s quixotic legal efforts and evidence-free claims of voter fraud have no chance at overturning the results of the presidential election, according to legal experts, they continue to shape Republicans\u2019 widespread reluctance to acknowledge the legitimacy of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s incoming administration, potentially setting the stage for even higher levels of polarization in Washington than before.       According to ABC News, Trump\u2019s latest Georgia lawsuit alleges that the state\u2019s election code was \u201cdisregarded, abandoned, ignored, altered, and otherwise violated,\u201d resulting in \u201ca sufficient number of illegal votes\u201d being included in the count. The lawsuit takes issue with rule changes regarding the eligibility of ballots, and includes allegations of fraud \u201cbased on witness affidavits, but with little evidence,\u201d ABC\u2019s Olivia Rubin and Matthew Mosk report. Trump\u2019s team is using these claims to call for \u201ca new Presidential Election to occur at the earliest opportune time.\u201d Georgia is in the midst of its third tally of votes overseen by Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, and Biden\u2019s margin of victory, while narrow, appears firm. Georgia\u2019s unprecedented hand-count audit confirmed Biden\u2019s victory over Trump, modestly reducing his margin of victory from 13,558 votes to 12,284 votes. And on Friday, preliminary results of a machine recount of the votes indicated that Biden is on track for a similar margin of victory on the third count of the ballots. The day that Trump\u2019s team filed the Georgia lawsuit, they also suffered two more legal defeats. In Nevada, a district judge denied a lawsuit from the Trump campaign contesting the state\u2019s results based on allegations of malfeasance. The judge said the legal team \u201cfailed to meet their burden to provide credible and relevant evidence.\u201d And the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to hear Trump\u2019s lawsuit attempting to overturn his loss. Trump and his allies have filed at least 46 lawsuits across the country and their efforts have gone poorly, with even conservative and Trump-appointed judges writing scathing rejections of lawsuits bereft of credible evidence of election official misconduct, incompetence, or fraud. Earlier this week, Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop summarized the state of Trump\u2019s \u201cstop the steal\u201d politicking: \u201cThe lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors.\u201d Trump has called on those state legislative leaders to aid him in stealing the election by appointing electors to the Electoral College who are willing to ignore the results of the election in their states and cast their votes for him rather than for Biden.  As Prokop has explained, this scheme would be difficult to pull off in states in which the GOP isn\u2019t in control of the legislature, courts, and governorship \u2014 and is also one that has been routinely rejected by Republican lawmakers in swing states like Michigan. Only in Pennsylvania have GOP lawmakers endorsed such a plan, and there, their plans appear set to be foiled by the state\u2019s Democratic House and governor. This leaves lawsuits as the president\u2019s only remaining avenue for overturning the election\u2019s results. But these lawsuits have become so transparently filed in bad faith that state and local officials are beginning to call for judges to sanction Trump campaign and Republican lawyers.  Legal experts aren\u2019t ruling out the possibility that judges could use financial penalties to deter future lawsuits, since Trump\u2019s legal efforts in many states have involve repeatedly bringing recycled, discredited claims and affidavits to court, a practice that could be deemed abusive. \u201cYou could see a court saying, \u2018Enough is enough,\u2019\u201d Daniel Weiner, deputy director of New York University\u2019s Brennan Center election reform program, told ABC News. Despite Biden\u2019s decisive victory in the Electoral College, and the dozens of lawsuits failing to gain any traction, the majority of Republican lawmakers in Washington have declined to question their legitimacy or acknowledge Biden\u2019s status as incoming president.  This week, the Washington Post surveyed every Republican in Congress, and found that fewer than 30 were willing to acknowledge Biden\u2019s victory over Trump. Meanwhile more than 200 Republican members of the House and Senate would \u201csimply not say who won the election.\u201d Trump responded to the results of the Post\u2019s survey with anger, and suggested he wanted to retaliate against the small minority of Republicans who acknowledged he lost the election. \u201cI am surprised there are so many,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday. \u201cWe have just begun to fight. Please send me a list of the 25 RINOS.\u201d RINO is an acronym which stands for \u201cRepublican in name only,\u201d typically used on the right to criticize a Republican for being insufficiently conservative. Trump\u2019s extended legal battles, combined with his weeks-long insistence on Twitter and other platforms that the election was rigged, have also had a strong effect on public opinion.  For example, a mid-November Economist/YouGov poll found that 89 percent of Trump voters believe that voter fraud affected the election outcome, and a majority think it changed the outcome.  While Trump\u2019s legal fights have surfaced no evidence of widespread fraud or misconduct, they have successfully lent credibility to his campaign to convince large swaths of the public that the election was stolen. And that might be their most important legacy.         ",

    "h1": "A federal court just reinstated DACA, and the implications go far beyond immigration",
    "first_p": "Late Friday afternoon, a federal district judge ordered the Trump administration to fully reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to live and work there. ",
    "article_text": "A federal court just reinstated DACA, and the implications go far beyond immigration Late Friday afternoon, a federal district judge ordered the Trump administration to fully reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to live and work there.  The case is Batalla Vidal v. Wolf. Judge Nicholas Garaufis, who handed down the order, said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must \u201cpost a public notice, within 3 calendar days of this Order ... that it is accepting first-time requests for consideration of deferred action under DACA\u201d because the department\u2019s ostensible leader tried to limit the DACA program without having the authority to do so. The ruling is the latest blow to the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to end the program. In 2017, Trump\u2019s DHS issued a memo that sought to wind down the DACA program, but the Supreme Court ruled last June that DHS\u2019s initial attempts to end it were void because the department did not adequately explain why it was doing so. Rather than fully reinstating DACA following the Supreme Court\u2019s order, however, DHS issued a new memo in July signed by Undersecretary of Homeland Security\u2019s Office for Strategy, Policy, and Plans Chad Wolf \u2014 and the lawfulness of this July memo was the central issue in Batalla Vidal. \u201cI have concluded that the DACA policy, at a minimum, presents serious policy concerns that may warrant its full rescission,\u201d Wolf wrote in that memo.  The memo directs \u201cDHS personnel to take all appropriate actions to reject all pending and future initial requests for DACA,\u201d and it provides that current DACA beneficiaries may only receive one-year renewals of their DACA status, rather than the two-year extensions they would have received prior to this memo. Wolf, moreover, purported to be far more than a mere undersecretary in his memorandum. In November of 2019, President Trump named Wolf acting Secretary of Homeland Security, and Wolf signed his July memo as \u201cActing Secretary.\u201d This distinction matters because as undersecretary, Wolf lacks the power to make changes to DACA, but the Secretary of Homeland Security does have the authority to make such changes. Judge Garaufis ruled in mid-November that Wolf \u201cwas not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security under the Homeland Security Act (\u2018HSA\u2019) when he issued the July 28, 2020 memorandum,\u201d thereby cutting the legs out from under Wolf\u2019s attempt to water down the DACA program. If Wolf is not the acting secretary, then his July memo is void. The order Garaufis handed down on Friday lays out some of the consequences of the judge\u2019s mid-November decision. \u201cBecause Mr. Wolf was without lawful authority to serve as Acting Secretary of OHS, the Wolf Memorandum is VACATED,\u201d Garaufis wrote in his most recent order. So the good news for DACA-eligible immigrants is that, barring a decision from a higher court blocking Garaufis\u2019s most recent order, those immigrants will soon be able to obtain DACA status. And even if the order is blocked, President-elect Joe Biden has also pledged to fully reinstate DACA once he takes office on January 20. Nevertheless, the future of DACA remains uncertain. For one thing, the Supreme Court\u2019s June decision blocking the Trump administration\u2019s initial attempts to end the program was a  5-4 decision, with the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the majority. Since then, Trump has replaced Ginsburg with the far more conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett. And even before Barrett arrived at the Supreme Court, several members of the Court had signaled that they thought DACA is illegal. So there\u2019s a reasonable likelihood that the Court\u2019s new 6-3 Republican majority will strike down the DACA program even as Biden tries to preserve it. The logic of Garaufis\u2019s November opinion \u2014 that presidents have only limited authority to make acting appointments \u2014 could also come back to bite Biden, especially if Republicans control the Senate and, with it, the power to block Biden\u2019s nominees. The core issue in the Batalla Vidal case turns on whether Wolf was lawfully appointed acting secretary, and therefore is empowered to make changes to the DACA program. Garaufis\u2019s opinion holding that Wolf was not lawfully appointed is fairly straightforward. The Homeland Security Act provides that, if DHS\u2019s top job becomes vacant, the deputy secretary shall act as secretary. If both jobs are vacant, then \u201cthe Under Secretary for Management shall serve as the Acting Secretary if by reason of absence, disability, or vacancy in office, neither the Secretary nor Deputy Secretary is available to exercise the duties of the Office of the Secretary.\u201d A sitting secretary, moreover, \u201cmay designate such other officers of the Department in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.\u201d Currently, DHS\u2019s top ranks are a bit a of ghost town. All three of the top jobs are vacant. Kirstjen Nielsen, the last person to serve as a Senate-confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security, resigned in April of 2019. Before she left, however, she did lay out the order of succession that should apply if the top three jobs at DHS became vacant. If all top three jobs were vacant, Nielsen determined, then the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency should become secretary \u2014 but this job has been vacant since the spring of 2019. Next in line would be the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) \u2014 a job that, until recently, was filled by Christopher Krebs.  Trump fired Krebs in mid-November after Krebs refuted false claims by Trump and some of Trump\u2019s allies that Biden somehow stole the 2020 election. But Krebs still was in his job as head of CISA in July, when Wolf handed down his DACA memo. That means that Krebs, not Wolf, should have been the acting secretary in July. It\u2019s worth noting that, even with Krebs out of the picture, Wolf still is not next in line to be acting secretary. After Krebs is the DHS\u2019s undersecretary for science and technology, but this position is vacant and the job is currently being done by a \u201cSenior Official Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary for Science and Technology.\u201d The next person in line after that is the undersecretary for intelligence and analysis, but that position is vacant as well, and the relevant office is held by an acting official. Eighth in line is the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, but that position is also vacant and there, too, the office is led by an acting official. Ninth in line is the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration. The TSA actually does have a Senate-confirmed leader \u2014 David Pekoske was confirmed to lead the TSA in 2017 \u2014 and he still holds that office. So it would appear that Pekoske, not Wolf, should currently be serving as acting secretary of DHS. As this litany of vacant offices and acting officials suggests, the courts have thus far been fairly tolerant of President Trump\u2019s attempts to bypass the Senate and fill top jobs with acting officials. But Judge Garaufis\u2019s order suggests that tolerance may be coming to an end just as Biden is preparing to take office. We do not yet know who will control the Senate at the beginning of the Biden administration. Currently, Republicans hold a 50-48 seat majority in the incoming Senate, with two seats to be determined in a January 5 Georgia runoff election.  If Democrats win both of those seats, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris\u2019s tiebreaking vote will give them a narrow majority in the Senate. But if Republicans prevail in either Georgia race, then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) will continue to lead the Senate, and Republicans will have the power to block any Biden nominee to any Senate-confirmed job. Biden, meanwhile, may find himself unable to staff his administration if Republicans choose to sabotage his presidency. While the Department of Homeland Security has a rigid order of succession for its top job, most agencies are governed by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act   (FVRA) when a Senate-confirmed position becomes vacant.  Under the FVRA, the president may temporarily fill a vacant, Senate-confirmed job with an acting appointee. But the president cannot fill the job with just anyone \u2014 typically the acting appointee must either be currently serving in a Senate-confirmed job, or be currently serving as a senior civil servant. Thus, if a vacancy arises in the middle of a presidency, that\u2019s typically no big deal. After the first year of a new presidency, the president will normally have appointed hundreds of individuals to Senate-confirmed jobs. So that gives the president a deep bench of officials to slide into acting roles as they are needed. But, at the beginning of Biden\u2019s presidency, he won\u2019t be able to rely on existing Senate-confirmed officials to serve as acting secretaries if the Senate refuses to confirm his nominees. With rare exceptions, the only people in Senate-confirmed jobs when Biden takes office will be Trump appointees.  Biden could potentially fill the vacant jobs with civil servants \u2014 that is, with senior career officials in the relevant agencies \u2014 but that could prevent Biden from naming a Cabinet that shares his political and policy vision. The FVRA imposes rigid limits on just how long an individual may serve in an acting role. Under many circumstances, the tenure of an acting official is limited to just 210 days after a vacancy arises. So even though Biden could fill many jobs temporarily with civil servants, many of those acting appointments will expire just seven months into his presidency. As mentioned above, the courts haven\u2019t exactly been rigorous in enforcing these restrictions under President Trump, but they now seem likely to take a new interest in enforcing laws like the FVRA once Biden takes office. A 6-3 Republican Supreme Court is unlikely to bend the law in order to help a Democratic president \u2014 and really, the law is quite clear that Biden does not have a limitless power to make acting appointments. A tremendous amount, in other words, is potentially at stake in the Georgia Senate runoffs. Those races could determine whether the Biden administration is able to perform many of the most basic functions of government \u2014 starting with actually getting people into top jobs within the administration.",

    "article_text": "The Trump administration extends the freeze on student loan payments through January Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has extended the pause on federal student loan payments due to the coronavirus pandemic through the end of January. The freeze on monthly payments and the accrual of interest on loans had been set to expire at the end of December, but Democrats and consumer advocacy groups had called for an extension, arguing that repayments should not begin again amid the presidential transition and that they should stay suspended, due to uncertainty over when another coronavirus relief bill may be passed by Congress. \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic has presented challenges for many students and borrowers, and this temporary pause in payments will help those who have been impacted,\u201d DeVos said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe added time also allows Congress to do its job and determine what measures it believes are necessary and appropriate. The Congress, not the executive branch, is in charge of student loan policy.\u201d Student loan relief \u2014 which began in March through the CARES Act, and was then extended by the Trump administration \u2014 has provided relief to over 40 million Americans as the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc on the economy, and put a strain on household incomes across the nation. And the economic picture appears unlikely to brighten soon \u2014 more than 5.8 million people are unemployed, and a new federal jobs report found job creation slowing. The student loan freeze has modestly improved credit scores of student loan borrowers and helped borrowers in default avoid penalties for non-payment, such as wage garnishment, according to the Urban Institute. While DeVos called on Congress to take action on relief, both the executive and legislative branches of government have options available for extending relief.  As Politico reports, the coronavirus relief bill passed by House Democrats in May would keep the freeze in place until September 30, 2021, unless the unemployment rate improves. And a bipartisan bill unveiled in the Senate this week potentially offers some kind of relief on payments through March. When President-elect Joe Biden takes office, he will have the option to extend the repayment moratorium through executive action just as the Trump administration did. But Democratic leaders, progressives, and many consumer advocacy groups are pushing for much more sweeping action on loan relief during Biden\u2019s tenure: the outright cancellation of federal student loans.  Some progressives, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have argued that the Higher Education Act gives the education secretary the \u201cauthority to begin to compromise and modify federal student loans,\u201d meaning that the president has the legal power to cancel student loan debt unilaterally.  As Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews has reported, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Warren have called on the Biden administration to use executive authority to forgive the first $50,000 in debt for every borrower with federal student loans. (Federal student loans make up over 92 percent of outstanding student loan balances, as opposed to privately issued loans.) Biden has preferred more modest cancellation measures. He has expressed support for far more limited student loan relief \u2014 forgiving $10,000 per borrower \u2014 but sources involved in his transition planning discussions told the New York Times that he prefers any cancellation measure to be authorized through congressional legislation, not executive action.  If Democrats succeed in taking control of the Senate after Georgia\u2019s two runoff elections \u2014 and therefore hold both chambers of Congress \u2014 there may be some more serious discussion of doing just that. But if Democrats fail to take control of the Senate in January\u2019s runoffs, pressure on Biden to take executive action to forgive loans may intensify.",

    "first_p": "Poverty actually fell in early to mid-2020, as the pandemic took hold, due to an unprecedented expansion of government safety net programs. But it has since grown and surpassed its early 2020 level, and is poised to increase more if the economic situation remains dire.",
    "article_text": "Joe Biden is taking office amid a poverty crisis Poverty actually fell in early to mid-2020, as the pandemic took hold, due to an unprecedented expansion of government safety net programs. But it has since grown and surpassed its early 2020 level, and is poised to increase more if the economic situation remains dire. Those are the major findings from projections made by researchers at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy (CPSP) at Columbia University, who have been developing methods for monthly estimates of poverty during the Covid-19 pandemic. The researchers \u2014 Zach Parolin, Chris Wimer, Jane Waldfogel, Jordan Matsudaira, and Megan Curran \u2014 use a metric known as the \u201csupplemental poverty measure,\u201d designed as a more consistent and reliable measure of hardship than the official poverty measure used by US government programs. Their metric is hardly perfect \u2014 critics argue it \u201cdefines poverty down\u201d by setting too low an income threshold \u2014 but it\u2019s useful for tracking variations like those experienced during the Covid-19 crisis.  According to their data, 15.5 percent of Americans, or 50.3 million people, were living in poverty in January 2020, before the coronavirus crisis began in earnest. In April, after relief measures began, the rate was down to 13.9 percent. The crisis continued, but many relief measures did not. The $1,200 \u201ceconomic impact payments\u201d (a.k.a. stimulus checks) were a one-off. The $600-per-week boost to unemployment insurance expired at the end of July. And poverty began creeping back up again, reaching 17.3 percent in August, and 16.7 percent, or about 54.2 million people, in September.  In other words, about 4 million more people were in poverty by September than were at the beginning of 2020. That\u2019s a quite large degradation in living standards. Looking ahead to January 2021 requires making some assumptions about unemployment. The rate as of October was 6.9 percent, a swift improvement from the peak of 14.7 percent in April. But it\u2019s still nearly double what it was in February before the crisis. The Columbia researchers\u2019 findings confirm that the January 2021 poverty situation will depend heavily on unemployment. They find that even if unemployment falls to 5 percent, which would be a big improvement, poverty will rise modestly from 16.7 percent in September to 17 percent in January, putting another 1 million or so people in poverty for a total of 55.2 million. If, on the other hand, unemployment remains elevated, the situation gets substantially worse. If it ticks up to 7.5 percent, then poverty will reach 18.1 percent, or 58.8 million people. If the situation deteriorates substantially and unemployment rises to 10 percent again, then poverty will rise to 19.1 percent of Americans \u2014 62.1 million. The upshot is this: Depending on the scale of the broader economic recovery, between 4.9 million and 11.8 million more people will be living in poverty in January 2021 than were in January 2020. This is a large increase even compared to the Great Recession. The same Columbia research group estimates that from 2007 to 2011, poverty measured the same way rose from 14.4 percent to 16.1 percent of the population, a 1.7-point increase. The best-case scenario of 5 percent unemployment in January 2021, by comparison, registers as a 1.5-point increase in poverty, similar in scale to the Great Recession. If we don\u2019t get down to 5 percent unemployment, the effects could be worse than the Great Recession. The Columbia team is not the only group of researchers attempting to track living standards for Americans in poverty on a monthly basis during this crisis. Jeehoon Han of Zhejiang University, Bruce Meyer of the University of Chicago, and James X. Sullivan at the University of Notre Dame have their own set of real-time measures, and while they do not calculate projections for January 2021, they tell the same story as the Columbia researchers about what happened from January to October 2020. The poverty rate, as they measure it, fell from 10.9 percent in January/February to 9.4 percent in April/May/June (they average months in an attempt to minimize error). But it then ticked up dramatically, from 9.4 percent to 11.3 percent in September and October. \u201cNearly 7 million have been added to the ranks of the poor since May,\u201d the researchers write in their most recent release. \u201cPoverty appears to have risen in October even though the unemployment rate fell by more than a percentage point.\u201d  That disconnect is partially a temporary result of the expiration of aid programs \u2014 but if it holds, then poverty could rise even more with falling unemployment than the Columbia numbers suggest. One thing to keep in mind when interpreting these two sets of numbers is that the Columbia team defines people and households as \u201cin poverty\u201d if they fall below a certain income threshold (adjusted for cost of living in their area and a few other factors) during a particular month. That has advantages, particularly during a rapidly evolving crisis like this one, but also disadvantages: It only counts tax credits, for instance, as income for the month when a person\u2019s tax refund is delivered. So if a low-income worker got a large earned income tax credit (EITC) in March, that counts as a several-thousand-dollar windfall for just that month \u2014 which helps explain why the Columbia measure sees poverty falling in March, even before Covid-19 relief measures were implemented. The Zhejiang/Chicago/Notre Dame team, by contrast, uses an annual reference period: It is trying to estimate how many people fell below a certain income level in the past 12 months. That gets around problems like the EITC but might make income fluctuations look smaller than they feel: If you lost all your pay in April, that would only show up as an 8 percent fall in your annual income, measured from the previous April. On a monthly basis, though, your income fell 100 percent. Another indication of an increase in that kind of short-run need is the nationwide surge in demand for supplies from food banks. A report from Hunger Free America found that in New York City, food pantries and soup kitchens fed 65.1 percent more people in 2020 than in 2019; that\u2019s compared to a 10 percent increase in people served the year before. The Greater Boston Food Bank told the Boston Globe that it went from distributing 1 million pounds of food per week to 415,000 people pre-pandemic to 2.5 million pounds per week to over 660,000 people.  The St. Louis Area Foodbank in Missouri reports that it went from distributing 3.1 million meals a month pre-pandemic to 5 million meals a month now. In Grand Rapids, the South Michigan Food Bank reported distributing more food in October than it had in any prior month in its 38-year history, covering both the early 1980s recession and the Great Recession. Underlying these trends is an increase in food insecurity, which is closely linked to income poverty. One of the first tasks the Biden administration will face in January is crafting a stimulus package that will pick up where the package that expired at the end of July left off. The expiration of the $600-a-week bonus unemployment benefit appears to have substantially increased need and poverty at the low end, and reviving a bonus benefit and providing other income support policies will be critical for avoiding further increases in poverty and returning the poverty rate to where it was in January 2020, if not lower. President-elect Biden has outlined what his preferred stimulus package would look like in considerable detail. It includes extending the $600-per-week unemployment insurance bonus; extensive aid to state, local, and tribal governments; and a $250-per-child monthly allowance for families, boosted to $300 per month per child for kids under 6. But congressional Democrats have struggled to get a deal matching these parameters through the Republican-controlled Senate, or even a more limited one with, say, $400 per week in bonus UI payments. Republican leader Mitch McConnell has insisted on a lower-cost package that includes civil immunity for businesses that put people at risk of Covid-19 infection. McConnell is likely to hold that line if he controls the Senate under Biden; control of the Senate will be determined in two Georgia runoff elections on January 5. The main challenge for policymakers interested in poverty alleviation, then, will be convincing McConnell and his allies to support stimulus and income support at the level that\u2019s needed to reverse the increase in poverty.

    "article_text": "Joe Biden is taking office amid a poverty crisis Poverty actually fell in early to mid-2020, as the pandemic took hold, due to an unprecedented expansion of government safety net programs. But it has since grown and surpassed its early 2020 level, and is poised to increase more if the economic situation remains dire. Those are the major findings from projections made by researchers at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy (CPSP) at Columbia University, who have been developing methods for monthly estimates of poverty during the Covid-19 pandemic. The researchers \u2014 Zach Parolin, Chris Wimer, Jane Waldfogel, Jordan Matsudaira, and Megan Curran \u2014 use a metric known as the \u201csupplemental poverty measure,\u201d designed as a more consistent and reliable measure of hardship than the official poverty measure used by US government programs. Their metric is hardly perfect \u2014 critics argue it \u201cdefines poverty down\u201d by setting too low an income threshold \u2014 but it\u2019s useful for tracking variations like those experienced during the Covid-19 crisis.  According to their data, 15.5 percent of Americans, or 50.3 million people, were living in poverty in January 2020, before the coronavirus crisis began in earnest. In April, after relief measures began, the rate was down to 13.9 percent. The crisis continued, but many relief measures did not. The $1,200 \u201ceconomic impact payments\u201d (a.k.a. stimulus checks) were a one-off. The $600-per-week boost to unemployment insurance expired at the end of July. And poverty began creeping back up again, reaching 17.3 percent in August, and 16.7 percent, or about 54.2 million people, in September.  In other words, about 4 million more people were in poverty by September than were at the beginning of 2020. That\u2019s a quite large degradation in living standards. Looking ahead to January 2021 requires making some assumptions about unemployment. The rate as of October was 6.9 percent, a swift improvement from the peak of 14.7 percent in April. But it\u2019s still nearly double what it was in February before the crisis. The Columbia researchers\u2019 findings confirm that the January 2021 poverty situation will depend heavily on unemployment. They find that even if unemployment falls to 5 percent, which would be a big improvement, poverty will rise modestly from 16.7 percent in September to 17 percent in January, putting another 1 million or so people in poverty for a total of 55.2 million. If, on the other hand, unemployment remains elevated, the situation gets substantially worse. If it ticks up to 7.5 percent, then poverty will reach 18.1 percent, or 58.8 million people. If the situation deteriorates substantially and unemployment rises to 10 percent again, then poverty will rise to 19.1 percent of Americans \u2014 62.1 million. The upshot is this: Depending on the scale of the broader economic recovery, between 4.9 million and 11.8 million more people will be living in poverty in January 2021 than were in January 2020. This is a large increase even compared to the Great Recession. The same Columbia research group estimates that from 2007 to 2011, poverty measured the same way rose from 14.4 percent to 16.1 percent of the population, a 1.7-point increase. The best-case scenario of 5 percent unemployment in January 2021, by comparison, registers as a 1.5-point increase in poverty, similar in scale to the Great Recession. If we don\u2019t get down to 5 percent unemployment, the effects could be worse than the Great Recession. The Columbia team is not the only group of researchers attempting to track living standards for Americans in poverty on a monthly basis during this crisis. Jeehoon Han of Zhejiang University, Bruce Meyer of the University of Chicago, and James X. Sullivan at the University of Notre Dame have their own set of real-time measures, and while they do not calculate projections for January 2021, they tell the same story as the Columbia researchers about what happened from January to October 2020. The poverty rate, as they measure it, fell from 10.9 percent in January/February to 9.4 percent in April/May/June (they average months in an attempt to minimize error). But it then ticked up dramatically, from 9.4 percent to 11.3 percent in September and October. \u201cNearly 7 million have been added to the ranks of the poor since May,\u201d the researchers write in their most recent release. \u201cPoverty appears to have risen in October even though the unemployment rate fell by more than a percentage point.\u201d  That disconnect is partially a temporary result of the expiration of aid programs \u2014 but if it holds, then poverty could rise even more with falling unemployment than the Columbia numbers suggest. One thing to keep in mind when interpreting these two sets of numbers is that the Columbia team defines people and households as \u201cin poverty\u201d if they fall below a certain income threshold (adjusted for cost of living in their area and a few other factors) during a particular month. That has advantages, particularly during a rapidly evolving crisis like this one, but also disadvantages: It only counts tax credits, for instance, as income for the month when a person\u2019s tax refund is delivered. So if a low-income worker got a large earned income tax credit (EITC) in March, that counts as a several-thousand-dollar windfall for just that month \u2014 which helps explain why the Columbia measure sees poverty falling in March, even before Covid-19 relief measures were implemented. The Zhejiang/Chicago/Notre Dame team, by contrast, uses an annual reference period: It is trying to estimate how many people fell below a certain income level in the past 12 months. That gets around problems like the EITC but might make income fluctuations look smaller than they feel: If you lost all your pay in April, that would only show up as an 8 percent fall in your annual income, measured from the previous April. On a monthly basis, though, your income fell 100 percent. Another indication of an increase in that kind of short-run need is the nationwide surge in demand for supplies from food banks. A report from Hunger Free America found that in New York City, food pantries and soup kitchens fed 65.1 percent more people in 2020 than in 2019; that\u2019s compared to a 10 percent increase in people served the year before. The Greater Boston Food Bank told the Boston Globe that it went from distributing 1 million pounds of food per week to 415,000 people pre-pandemic to 2.5 million pounds per week to over 660,000 people.  The St. Louis Area Foodbank in Missouri reports that it went from distributing 3.1 million meals a month pre-pandemic to 5 million meals a month now. In Grand Rapids, the South Michigan Food Bank reported distributing more food in October than it had in any prior month in its 38-year history, covering both the early 1980s recession and the Great Recession. Underlying these trends is an increase in food insecurity, which is closely linked to income poverty. One of the first tasks the Biden administration will face in January is crafting a stimulus package that will pick up where the package that expired at the end of July left off. The expiration of the $600-a-week bonus unemployment benefit appears to have substantially increased need and poverty at the low end, and reviving a bonus benefit and providing other income support policies will be critical for avoiding further increases in poverty and returning the poverty rate to where it was in January 2020, if not lower. President-elect Biden has outlined what his preferred stimulus package would look like in considerable detail. It includes extending the $600-per-week unemployment insurance bonus; extensive aid to state, local, and tribal governments; and a $250-per-child monthly allowance for families, boosted to $300 per month per child for kids under 6. But congressional Democrats have struggled to get a deal matching these parameters through the Republican-controlled Senate, or even a more limited one with, say, $400 per week in bonus UI payments. Republican leader Mitch McConnell has insisted on a lower-cost package that includes civil immunity for businesses that put people at risk of Covid-19 infection. McConnell is likely to hold that line if he controls the Senate under Biden; control of the Senate will be determined in two Georgia runoff elections on January 5. The main challenge for policymakers interested in poverty alleviation, then, will be convincing McConnell and his allies to support stimulus and income support at the level that\u2019s needed to reverse the increase in poverty.

    "article_text": "The rise in murders in the US, explained As if the Covid-19 pandemic wasn\u2019t bad enough, America is also seeing a surge in homicides this year. A new report, by the Council on Criminal Justice, found homicides have increased sharply this year across 21 US cities with relevant data: \u201cHomicide rates increased by 42% during the summer and 34% in the fall over the summer and fall of 2019.\u201d Other data, from crime analyst Jeff Asher, found murder is up 36 percent throughout the year so far, compared to the same period in 2019, in a sample of 51 US cities. A preliminary FBI report also found murders up 15 percent nationwide in the first half of 2020. The increase in homicides is large and widespread enough to raise serious alarms for criminologists and other experts. So what\u2019s going on? Some experts have cited the protests this summer over the police killings of George Floyd and others \u2014 which could\u2019ve had a range of effects, from officers pulling back from their duties to greater community distrust in police, leading to more unchecked violence. Others point to the bad economy. Another potential factor is a huge increase in gun purchases this year. Still others posit boredom and social displacement as a result of physical distancing leading people to cause more trouble. Above all, though, experts caution it\u2019s simply been a very unusual year with the Covid-19 pandemic. That makes it difficult to say what, exactly, is happening with crime rates. \u201cThe current year, 2020, is an extreme deviation from baseline \u2014 extreme,\u201d Tracey Meares, founding director at the Justice Collaboratory at Yale Law School, previously told me. That offers a bit of good news: It\u2019s possible that the end of the pandemic will come and homicide rates will fall again, as they generally have for the past few decades in the US. But no one knows for sure if that will happen, or if we\u2019re now seeing a shift in long-term trends. Uncertainty about what\u2019s going on isn\u2019t exactly new in the field of criminal justice. Rates of crime and violence have plummeted over the past few decades in the US, yet there is no agreed-upon explanation for why. There are theories applying the best evidence, research, and data available, ranging from changes in policing to a drop in lead exposure to the rise of video games. But there\u2019s no consensus. That a decades-long phenomenon is still so hard to explain shows the need for humility before jumping to conclusions about the current trends. \u201cWe don\u2019t know nearly enough to know what\u2019s going on at the given moment,\u201d Jennifer Doleac, director of the Justice Tech Lab, previously told me. \u201cThe current moment is so unusual for so many different reasons that \u2026 it\u2019s really hard to speculate about broad phenomena that are driving these trends when we\u2019re not even sure if there\u2019s a trend yet.\u201d All of that said, here\u2019s what we do know. There are several good sources, from criminologists, economists, and other data analysts, for what\u2019s happened with crime and violence so far this year: an analysis by Jeff Asher; a Council on Criminal Justice report written by Richard Rosenfeld and Ernesto Lopez; City Crime Stats, a website from the University of Pennsylvania set up by David Abrams, Priyanka Goonetilleke, Elizabeth Holmdahl, and Kathy Qian; and a preliminary report from the FBI. Crime analyst Jeff Asher offers the most recent data, looking at crime trends in 51 US cities in 2020 so far compared to 2019. He found murders are up 36 percent. Despite previous comments by President Donald Trump blaming the increase on Democrat-run cities, Asher found murders are up about 36 percent in both cities with Democratic mayors and those with Republican mayors. In a smaller sample of US cities, he found violent crime overall is flat and property crimes are down. The Council on Criminal Justice report, updated in November, analyzed crime in 28 US cities, ranging in size from Los Angeles to St. Petersburg, Florida, through October. The authors looked for \u201cstructural breaks,\u201d in which reported crime increased or decreased more than would be expected, based on data from previous years. They found structural breaks in homicide, aggravated assault, and gun assault increases, particularly starting in the summer. There weren\u2019t significant increases in domestic assault (although the data for domestic violence is fairly limited), and robbery was actually down. Other kinds of crime, including larceny and drug offenses, largely decreased. Here\u2019s the graph for homicide increases: \u201cThere were 610 more homicides in the 21 cities in the summer and fall of 2020 than during the same period in 2019,\u201d the report found. City Crime Stats\u2019 data complicates matters a bit, comparing the 2020 crime trends in 28 major cities to a five-year baseline. With this approach, the homicide increases don\u2019t seem quite as dramatic in many cities, and other types of crime appear to be mostly down as well. Still, homicides do seem to be significantly up in many of the cities included in the City Crime Stats data set.  Here, for example, is Chicago\u2019s homicide trend, which shows this year\u2019s rate (the red line) rising above the five-year baseline (the gray line and shading) at several points throughout the year: There\u2019s a lot of variation from city to city. Minneapolis, Milwaukee, New York City, and Philadelphia are on the high end of homicides or seeing a flat-out increase. Baltimore, Boston, and Columbus are close to historical trends or actually down. Overall, though, Abrams said that his data suggests there was a significant increase in homicides from May to June: \u201cWe did find a statistically significant increase in homicides \u2014 about 21 percent \u2014 in aggregate in the cities we looked at in the month after versus before those protests,\u201d he previously told me, cautioning we can\u2019t say with any confidence if the protests were the cause. \u201cSame for shootings, but that\u2019s from a smaller number of cities.\u201d A preliminary FBI report confirmed these other reports\u2019 findings for the first half of 2020. It found a 15 percent increase in murders, a 5 percent increase in aggravated assaults, and an 8 percent decrease in property crime nationwide from January through June, compared to the same time period in 2019. The FBI will likely release a report for all of 2020 later in 2021. In Chicago, as well as some other cities, the apparent increase in homicides began before the protests over the police killing of George Floyd. And in some cases, as in Chicago, the spike abruptly ended almost as quickly as it started, only to surge again weeks later, after the protests had calmed. So it\u2019s hard to blame only the protests for a spike \u2014 especially because we know that other factors likely played a role, such as the start of summer, when crime tends to go up, and the end of stay-at-home orders. City-by-city variation isn\u2019t unique to 2020. It\u2019s expected, even when talking about national crime waves or declines, to see some places go up and others go down for different kinds of crime. The US is a big country, and a range of local factors can affect different kinds of crime. Still, there\u2019s enough in the four data sets to draw some conclusions: Homicides are up significantly this year. But other kinds of crime, including violent crime overall, aren\u2019t up and may actually have decreased so far this year. There was also a brief spike in burglaries in major cities starting in late May \u2014 an increase that was so brief and contained to specific cities that experts told me it was almost certainly due to the riots and looting surrounding some Black Lives Matter protests. As Asher noted on Twitter, a disconnect between murders and other crimes would be odd: \u201cViolent crime and murder almost always move in the same direction and they are never this far apart nationally.\u201d One way to reconcile this may be the nature of crime reporting. All of this data is based on reports to governments, typically local police departments. But with people stuck at home, and no government agency operating normally this year, perhaps these reports are just less likely to happen or get picked up, especially lower-level crimes involving drugs or stolen property. At the same time, it\u2019s far harder for a homicide to go completely unreported \u2014 it\u2019s difficult to ignore a dead person. This is why, for much of US history, the homicide rate has been used as a proxy for violent crime overall: The nature of homicide made it a more reliable metric than others for crime. In other words, it\u2019s possible that other kinds of crime are up this year, but they\u2019re simply going unreported. At any rate, homicides are up significantly. One note on domestic violence: Some activists and experts worried it would increase this year as people were forced to stay home more often. The Council on Criminal Justice report and City Crime Stats\u2019 analysis suggest that\u2019s not the case, showing no significant change or a drop in some places. But there\u2019s reason for skepticism: Both sources are pulling data from a limited number of cities. And reporting limitations may especially apply to domestic violence, since this year victims are potentially more likely to be trapped with their abusers and unable to make a phone call for help. There are plenty of caveats to all this data. Much of it only represents trends in large US cities, which means it might not be representative of the country as a whole. And it only covers 2020 through November at the latest. But the trends, particularly with homicides, are very alarming. So why are homicides up? When I posed this question to experts, they again cautioned that no one can say with certainty what\u2019s going on. That said, they offered some possible explanations, based on the limited information we have so far: 1) The pandemic has really messed things up: Looming over absolutely every discussion about 2020 is the Covid-19 pandemic. That\u2019s no different for discussions about crime and violence. This year is very unusual, with many forced to stay at home and living in fear of a new, deadly virus. That could lead to all sorts of unpredictable behaviors that experts don\u2019t understand yet and might take years to explain. 2) Depolicing led to more violence: In response to the 2014 and 2015 waves of Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality, officers in some cities pulled back, either out of fear that any act of aggressive policing could get them in trouble or in a counterprotest against Black Lives Matter. While protesters have challenged the crime-fighting effectiveness of police, there is a sizable body of evidence that more, and certain kinds of, policing do lead to less crime. Given that, some experts said that depolicing in response to protests could have led to more violence \u2014 what some in years past called the \u201cFerguson effect,\u201d after the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police shooting of Michael Brown, and also seen in Baltimore after the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray. 3) Lack of trust in police led to more violence: In response to the \u201cFerguson effect\u201d in 2015, some experts offered a different view of what was happening: Maybe people had lost trust in the police and, as a result, they relied more on street justice and other illegal activities to resolve interpersonal disputes \u2014 an interpretation of \u201clegal cynicism,\u201d explained well in Jill Leovy\u2019s Ghettoside and supported by some empirical research. Perhaps Floyd\u2019s killing and the ensuing protests led to a similar phenomenon this year. 4) More guns led to more gun violence: There\u2019s been a big surge in gun buying this year, seemingly in response to concerns about personal safety during a pandemic. And as the research has shown time and time again, more guns mean more gun violence. A recent, preliminary study from researchers at UC Davis already concluded that gun purchases led to more gun violence than there would be otherwise through May this year. That could have further exacerbated homicide increases. 5) Overwhelmed hospitals led to more deaths: One way to explain a flat or dropping violent crime rate as homicides rise is that the violent crime was deadlier than usual. With health care systems across the US at times close to capacity or at capacity due to Covid-19, maybe hospitals and their staff couldn\u2019t treat violent crime victims as well \u2014 increasing the chances they died this year. That could translate to more deaths, and homicides, even if violent crime remained flat or declined. 6) Idle hands led to more violence: Throughout the pandemic, a lot of people have been bored \u2014 with forms of entertainment, from restaurants to movie theaters, closed down. Schools are limited or closed too, and millions have been newly unemployed. Other support programs that can prevent violence were shuttered due to the closures. All of that could have led to conflict, and possibly more crime and violence. But, experts cautioned, this is speculative, with little evidence so far to support it. 7) A bad economy led to more violence: With the economy tanking this year, some people may have been pushed to desperate acts to make ends meet. Disruptions in the drug market, as product and customers dried up in a bad economy, may have led to more violent competition over what\u2019s left. The bad economy also left local and state governments with less funding for social supports that can keep people out of trouble. All of that, and more, could have contributed to more crime and violence \u2014 but this, too, is still very speculative. Another possibility: None of these explanations is right. With limited data in strange times, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it turns out we have no idea what\u2019s going on right now. \u201cWe can bet on it being unpredictable,\u201d Doleac said. Again, there\u2019s still no consensus about what\u2019s caused crime to decline since the 1990s. In that context, it\u2019s no surprise there\u2019s nowhere near a consensus as to why a homicide spike has occurred so far this year. It\u2019s possible that before we understand why it\u2019s happening, the year\u2019s alarming homicide trends could recede. It\u2019s happened before: In 2005 and 2006, the homicide rate briefly increased, only to start declining again before hitting record lows in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the rates also spiked again only to start to dip after. In both instances, these years were effectively blips and the overall crime decline America has seen for the past three decades continued. Maybe after this very weird year ends, crime and violence trends will, similarly, go back to the previous normal. But that\u2019s not a guarantee \u2014 and it\u2019s not something we should rely on, experts said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand why crime and violence went down,\u201d John Roman, a criminal justice expert at NORC at the University of Chicago, previously told me. \u201cBeing able to say we should expect this unexplained phenomenon to continue strikes me as sort of irrational.\u201d Even if we can\u2019t explain what may be causing a homicide spike, there are certain strategies that might help fight crime in the short term \u2014 such as deploying police in crime hot spots (though that would have to be done carefully and with reforms, given the current political climate around policing), a \u201cfocused deterrence\u201d program that targets the few people in a community engaging in violence with a mix of support and sanctions, and using civilian \u201cinterrupters\u201d to personally intervene in cases in which violence seems likely to break out. Notably, a lot of this work is done at the local and state level, where the vast majority of police departments are based. The federal government can incentivize certain practices, like President-elect Joe Biden has proposed doing, but it ultimately falls on cities, counties, and states to carry out new or revised approaches. Many of the evidence-based approaches rely on in-person contact, which requires ending the pandemic. \u201cThe police, public health, and community approaches to violence reduction require that people meet face-to-face; they cannot be replaced by Zoom,\u201d Rosenfeld and Lopez wrote in one of their reports. \u201cAn underappreciated consequence of the pandemic is how social-distancing requirements have affected outreach to high-risk individuals.\u201d So the first priority should be to end the pandemic \u2014 ending its potential ripple effects on crime and enabling evidence-based approaches that can help reduce crime. But to do that, the US public and governments will need to truly embrace strategies that have worked for countries like South Korea and Germany against Covid-19: physical distancing, masking, and testing, tracing, and isolating the sick. In this sense, Trump\u2019s failures to address Covid-19 may be leading to more violence. \u201cSeeing what\u2019s happening with these [crime] numbers can point us to or at least get us thinking about what potential policy levers we could employ that would be helpful,\u201d Doleac said. \u201cOtherwise, our attention is probably better focused on making sure we\u2019re all wearing masks.\u201d Beyond the pandemic, police are going to have more trouble fighting crime \u2014 including any current or future spikes \u2014 if large segments of the community don\u2019t trust them. That\u2019s where police reform comes into play. It\u2019s a complicated topic, separate from a possible spike in violence this year. But, in short, experts say police should, at a minimum, show the communities they serve that they understand the concerns, acknowledge mistakes, and will change how officers are trained and deployed. Otherwise, there\u2019s a good chance that protests against police will flare up, just as they did from 2014 to 2016 and have again this year. If protests lead to more violence \u2014 whether by leading to depolicing, or sowing and exposing distrust in law enforcement \u2014 that\u2019s going to create public safety problems. To put it another way: There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about crime, why it happens, and how to stop it. But it\u2019s going to be much easier to wrap our heads around these issues once things get closer to how they should be \u2014 and that means seriously addressing the pandemic and protests against police brutality. Unfortunately, the US is going in the opposite direction, with a surge of Covid-19 this fall and winter and Trump exacerbating police-community tensions with his rhetoric and push to deploy unsolicited federal agents in some US cities. \u201cHow optimistic should we be for the rest of the summer?\u201d Roman said. \u201cI think the answer is not terribly optimistic, because none of these factors seem to be abating with the return of Covid.\u201d  ",

    "article_text": "9 questions about the Georgia Senate runoffs you were too embarrassed to ask  Georgia voters will determine which party controls the US Senate on January 5, and thus decide the fate of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. There are not one but two runoff Senate elections in Georgia early next year. They have similar dynamics, with Democratic challengers going up against Republican incumbents. One race features a matchup between Sen. David Perdue (R) and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other involves Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters who requested them starting on November 18, while in-person early voting starts on December 14 and continues until Election Day on January 5. At first glance, Democrats appear to be the underdogs. Georgia is historically Republican, and Democrats haven\u2019t had a good track record in past Senate runoffs, losing the most recent one in 2008. At the same time, Democrats insist several things are different this year: Their party\u2019s presidential nominee won the state for the first time in almost 30 years, they have two candidates, and the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance. Enthusiasm against President Trump ultimately aided Biden in the presidential election, and Democrats are clearly hoping for a repeat on that front. But the big unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s continued refusal to concede will play into all of this. \u201cTrump is not on the ballot, but are we in a post-Trump era where our people are motivated to show up?\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cThat is the big question.\u201d Georgia\u2019s runoff system is unusual in American politics, and the dynamics this year are also unusual. The results of these races will potentially have an outsize influence on the next four years.  We\u2019ve broken down the essential questions here.   There\u2019s a huge amount at stake for both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia. The state will decide which party controls the US Senate \u2014 and, by extension, whether there will be divided or unified government in Washington, DC. \u201cDemocrats are going to be very excited in Georgia but also nationally,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock recently told Vox. \u201cOssoff and Warnock, any kind of resource or help they need, they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Republicans are equally energized to keep the Senate in GOP hands so they can have a definitive say in the agenda of President-elect Biden. The ambitiousness of Biden\u2019s agenda as president hangs in the balance, as does his ability to select Cabinet members and judicial nominees \u2014 all of whom are confirmed by the Senate. The only problem: Many Republicans cannot publicly admit that Biden has officially won without angering Trump. Being hamstrung hampers their argument on this front.  \u201cWe\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be standing out here alone,\u201d Perdue said on a recent private donor call obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can\u2019t wait for that.\u201d To be clear, winning both seats won\u2019t give Democrats license to pass a raft of leftist legislation. Democrats\u2019 best-case scenario right now is a 50-50 split Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote for a simple majority.  But Democrats still have a number of conservative members in their caucus like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), who will likely temper their ambition and prioritize bipartisan cooperation with Republicans. They\u2019ll also likely have to deal with the Senate filibuster, needing 60 votes to pass major bills.  Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",

    "article_text": "The battle over Trump\u2019s huge UAE arms deal, explained On Monday evening, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee met for a classified briefing with Trump administration officials to hear about a proposed $23 billion weapons sale to the United Arab Emirates. Right when it ended, one of the attendees blasted what had transpired behind closed doors. \u201cJust a mind blowing number of unsettled issues and questions the Administration couldn\u2019t answer,\u201d tweeted Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy. \u201cHard to overstate the danger of rushing this though.\u201d That remark underscored the growing political fight over the arms deal announced in early November, a standoff that could severely impact America\u2019s relations with its authoritarian ally and the military balance in the Middle East.  President Donald Trump wants to sell up to 50 F-35 fighter jets, nearly 20 Reaper drones, and around 14,000 bombs and munitions to the UAE \u2014 and he wants to do it before President-elect Joe Biden enters the Oval Office and potentially scuttles the sale.  The administration has explicitly linked the massive arms package to Trump\u2019s broader efforts to counter Iran and to the UAE\u2019s normalization of relations with Israel in August. \u201cThis is in recognition of our deepening relationship and the UAE\u2019s need for advanced defense capabilities to deter and defend itself against heightened threats from Iran,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement announcing his authorization of the sales. \u201cThe UAE\u2019s historic agreement to normalize relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to positively transform the region\u2019s strategic landscape.\u201d But some Republicans and Democrats in Congress, along with certain activist groups, oppose the proposed weapons transfer, saying a country responsible for killing civilians in Yemen and funding Russian mercenaries in Libya doesn\u2019t deserve to be rewarded with even better US-made weapons.  \u201cTo sell such advanced military equipment to the UAE now would be to endorse those policies and threaten US interests and regional stability,\u201d said Seth Binder, an advocacy officer at the Project on Middle East Democracy, who\u2019s leading an effort by arms control organizations and human rights groups to stop the sale. Which means the next 50 days before Biden takes over will see a nasty tussle over one of Trump\u2019s last major foreign policy initiatives, one he\u2019s trying to ram through before the clock runs out. \u201cThis is happening way too fast,\u201d said Michael Hanna, a Middle East security expert at the Century Foundation in New York City. \u201cProcess is important, substance is important, and neither is good here.\u201d The UAE has long wanted advanced fighter jets and top-of-the-line drones, which would make it a greater, more powerful player in the region \u2014 not just militarily, but politically, too. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about going to war here. We\u2019re talking about affecting change in the Middle East,\u201d said Dalia Fahmy, an expert on the UAE\u2019s foreign policy at Long Island University. \u201cThe UAE is reasserting itself in the region. It\u2019s all about being able to leverage that perceived power.\u201d In other words, the UAE wants the world\u2019s most advanced warplane, the F-35, and surveillance and attack drones because it could then throw its weight around in the Middle East. That sounds fine in principle \u2014 after all, most nations seek to increase their power and influence whenever they can. But one big question is how \u2014 and where \u2014 exactly the UAE may try to do that. The sale is \u201cnot helpful [for the US] if there is greater adventurism in Libya or the Horn of Africa,\u201d said a State Department official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to press. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe helpful in a theoretical multilateral framework\u201d against Iran. Both Trump and Biden would certainly rather see the country use the weapons against Iran in case of a war and not, say, to bomb innocent men, women, and children in Yemen, where the UAE is fighting a war as part of a Saudi-led coalition. Figuring out what assurances the US received from the UAE ahead of the sales took up much of Monday\u2019s classified Senate hearing, according to two Senate sources familiar with the discussion.  Murphy\u2019s tweet made clear the answers senators received weren\u2019t satisfactory \u2014 and now he and others are trying to stop the transfers from happening. On November 18, three senators \u2014 Democrats Murphy and Senate Foreign Relations ranking member Robert Menendez, along with Republican Rand Paul \u2014 introduced four joint resolutions to stop the UAE arms deal from happening. \u201cCongress is once again stepping in to serve as a check to avoid putting profit over US national security and that of our allies, and to hopefully prevent a new arms race in the Middle East,\u201d Menendez said in a statement at the time. Those resolutions must be voted on and passed by December 11 or they will expire, clearing Trump\u2019s pathway to the sale. But whether or not the blocking effort works, the resolutions do help make clear the five main arguments against the deal. The first, as mentioned above, is that the UAE could use the weapons indiscriminately, killing civilians in Yemen or elsewhere. Without clear guarantees that that won\u2019t happen, the senators and activists don\u2019t want the measure moving forward. The second concern is that Israel could lose what\u2019s called its \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d (QME) in the Middle East. Simply put, US policy since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war has been to ensure that Israel has more powerful forces than its Arab neighbors. Israel and others fear giving the UAE F-35s and drones might erode that advantage. However, that issue \u201chas receded in importance\u201d more recently, said Barbara Leaf, the US ambassador to the UAE from 2014 to 2018. The main reason is that in October, Israel\u2019s government dropped its objection to the F-35 transfers in particular, soon after the Pentagon promised Jerusalem its edge would remain intact.  \u201cIt\u2019s now more about the foreign policy dimensions of the proposed sale,\u201d Leaf told me. Which brings us to the third objection: that the UAE having this advanced weaponry could change the balance of power in the Middle East, making the Gulf country an even stronger, more influential regional player. If that were the case, experts told me, the UAE might use its newfound strength to attack its enemies, namely Iran, on its own and back other proxies in the area. But some aren\u2019t so worried about that possibility. \u201cThis won\u2019t change the military balance in the Middle East,\u201d said Leaf, now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Washington, DC. \u201cIran\u2019s missile and nonconventional arsenals are formidable and could wreak immense damage, even if the UAE gets the F-35.\u201d The fourth concern is the potential for an arms race. Basically, if the UAE gets a lot of advanced weapons, others \u2014 like Qatar and Iran, the UAE\u2019s adversaries \u2014 might want them, too. At that point, each country may continue to buy more and more weapons until the region becomes increasingly militarized and dangerous. That\u2019s an outcome many experts hope to avoid, although such a possibility remains far off. The fifth worry is that the Trump administration is ramming through in a matter of months a deal that would normally take years to complete. \u201cThis is definitely being rushed through. That\u2019s abnormal and bad practice,\u201d said the Century Foundation\u2019s Hanna. What normally happens is that a deal is painstakingly worked out between the two parties first, then reviewed closely by the State Department and the Pentagon, and then long-term consultations with Congress begin. One item up for debate would be the Israel issue, for example, which could take years to hash out.  In this case, the Trump administration wants to go from an announcement in November to a sale before January 20, the day Biden is sworn in as president. That\u2019s just unheard of, especially for an arms package of this size. That\u2019s why one Senate aide told me they don\u2019t want to see the deal go through before \u201cthey\u2019ve dotted the i\u2019s and crossed the t\u2019s.\u201d Until then, the backlash against the deal is likely to persist.

    "article_text": "Joe Biden should do everything at once Joe Biden will become the US president during an extraordinary moment in history, one that could very well prove to be the calm before the storm, a brief prelude to dissolution and illiberalism. Trump\u2019s bid to become a full-on authoritarian failed, but Democrats could easily lose the House in a 2022 backlash. Biden could face total congressional opposition, even impeachment \u2014 as the recent baseless \u201cstolen election\u201d narrative has shown, if Republicans don\u2019t have any evidence, they\u2019ll just make something up.  Or maybe Democrats will keep the House and take the Senate in 2022, and legislation will become possible! Who knows? (The Georgia Senate runoffs are another big question mark.) If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned over the past five years, it\u2019s that I definitely don\u2019t know what is going to happen next, and it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone else does either. What we do know is that Republicans will wage full-on war on Biden from the second he takes office. They will generate fake conspiracies and controversies through right-wing media and social media. Conservative voters will be told again and again that Biden and Kamala Harris are uniquely dangerous traitors engaged in all sorts of elaborate evil plots. The entire conservative movement, from top to bottom, will view limiting Biden to one term as its primary strategic objective. And the movement will engage in misinformation, norm violation, procedural fuckery, and outright lawbreaking, if necessary, to achieve that objective.  The right will be what it is, what it has been becoming for decades now; expecting anything else would be madness. The question is how the Biden administration should behave, knowing all this. It would be foolish for anyone to claim to have all the answers, or any of the answers really, but in my mind the most pointed lesson about how to behave in a hopelessly partisan environment comes from Donald Trump himself. Before getting to that (suspense!), it\u2019s instructive to take a look back at some of the experiences of the administration for which Biden was vice president. When Barack Obama took office in 2009 in a deepening recession, he expected to receive some Republican help bailing out the economy. It\u2019s easy today to look back on that expectation as naive, but at the time it wasn\u2019t unreasonable. The economy was on the brink of disaster, the need was clear, and the depth of conservative backlash was not yet as evident as it would become later.  What happened instead was a wall of opposition from Republicans, built on bad-faith objections about deficit spending and government waste. With so little room to maneuver, Democrats were forced to negotiate with the tiny handful of moderate Republicans and the large handful of conservative Democrats in the Senate, holding the stimulus bill down to their arbitrary spending caps. In the end, the stimulus bill passed with zero Republican votes in the House and just three in the Senate. The result was an inadequate economic boost and a sluggish recovery that hobbled the rest of Obama\u2019s presidency. Since it was widely agreed that \u201cpolitical capital\u201d was limited and Democrats could only take on one fight at a time, the question then became what to tackle next. The answer proved to be health care reform, perceived as a policy better developed and more widely supported in the Democratic caucus.  In July 2009, Democrats in the House introduced a health care plan based on a system that had been road-tested by Mitt Romney in his recent tenure as governor in Massachusetts. Many Democrats thought the process would take a few months, and then Congress could move on to climate change. Instead, again and again, Republicans lured Democrats into extended negotiations, only to withdraw support at the last minute over some new bad-faith objection (see: \u201cdeath panels\u201d). That left Democrats negotiating with their most conservative members, who did much the same thing (Joe Lieberman, may his name live in infamy). In the end, talks dragged on until March 2010, when Obama finally signed the Affordable Care Act. It got no Republican votes, in the Senate or the House.  Then it was finally time for climate change, and the strategy there was yet more clever sequencing. Obama told Republicans that if they didn\u2019t cooperate on climate change legislation, he would regulate greenhouse gases via the Environmental Protection Agency, which would offer less flexibility and less ability to compensate hard-hit communities. The idea was that the threat of EPA regulations \u2014 made inevitable by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA judgment that carbon dioxide is a pollutant subject to the Clean Air Act \u2014 would frighten Republicans to the legislative table, where they could better defend their interests.  Instead, Republicans vowed implacable opposition to all of it. They would fight furiously against legislation when it was on the table and then fight regulations just as furiously when they came up. To a cool Vulcan mind like Obama\u2019s, it seemed entirely irrational, against Republicans\u2019 own best interests. At that point, he had not fully internalized the extent to which the conservative movement has become unleashed id, driven more by right-wing media than by Republican politicians, fueled by resentment and organized purely to defeat the libs.  In June 2009, when the climate bill passed the House, it got eight Republican votes. By mid-2010, it was dead in the water, with no hope of any Republican votes in the Senate. Democrats no longer had their filibuster-proof 60 seats, and there was nothing like the same support in the caucus that health care reform generated, so it never came to a Senate vote. It ended with a whimper, not a bang. As promised, Obama\u2019s EPA began slowly rolling out regulations, one at a time. It wasn\u2019t until late in his first term that auto mileage standards were finalized and into his second term before EPA got to power plants. Republicans were able to keep Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan tied up in court through the end of his second term. Then Trump took power and began a simultaneous all-fronts assault on Obama\u2019s regulations, unrolling them so fast it was difficult to even keep track. The theme of these stories is that Democrats relied on clever sequencing over and over again, imagining some amount of political capital (\u201ccredibility\u201d) that they could husband and spend strategically to get assistance across the aisle, at every juncture underestimating the ferocity and unanimity of Republican opposition. They kept behaving as though they would find good-faith negotiating partners, as though they were still in the postwar American era of relatively low (or at least manageable) polarization.  What too few of them realized was that they were already in a new era of near-total polarization, with the population sorted into like-minded enclaves, a bifurcated media ecosystem nurturing stacked (and diametrically opposed) \u201cmega-identities,\u201d and voters motivated primarily by \u201cnegative partisanship,\u201d which is to say, hatred of the other side.  A fully polarized two-party system really is a zero-sum game. Any victories or gains by one side come at the other side\u2019s expense, even if the victory secures shared goals. The rational course for the party out of power is to fight with full intensity against everything, always, and that\u2019s what Republicans did under Obama. With scarcely any exceptions, from 2010 through 2020, they pushed in every case for maximal partisan advantage, no matter the stakes or possible cost.  The GOP has failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite a few close calls, but otherwise, its unprincipled pursuit of raw power has paid off handsomely. The party captured state legislatures in 2010 and was able to gerrymander itself minority rule in several states. It practically shut down Congress as a legislative body for six years of Obama\u2019s term. It blocked Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court and for its efforts got Neil Gorsuch. It ignored Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s dying wishes and for its efforts got a 6-3 conservative Court majority that could last for generations.  Republicans blocked so many Democratic judicial nominations that Senate leader Harry Reid had to get rid of the judicial filibuster to keep the courts staffed. Then, when the GOP took control of the presidency and Senate, it used the absence of the filibuster to pack the federal courts full of hyper-ideological, young, often woefully unqualified judges. Rather than paying any price for total partisan warfare, Republicans were rewarded in 2016 with the presidency and both houses of Congress. After carrying the country to the brink of authoritarian crisis, it has now lost the House and the presidency. But Joe Biden has been left to tackle a virtually uncontrolled pandemic and millions of people out of work and on the verge of homelessness or food insecurity.  The GOP will likely retain control of the Senate, which means there will be no adequate economic recovery package and none of Biden\u2019s ambitious campaign plans will come to fruition. It has kept control of key state legislatures, so it will be able to gerrymander itself an advantage for another decade. The elections of 2022 will be another partisan brawl, and the odds are stacked against Democrats; the president\u2019s party has lost seats in every first-term midterm in the past 100 years, save three. If Republicans gain full control of Congress, impeachment becomes a real possibility, even if conviction is very unlikely. It\u2019s a grim situation, and Biden is starting out behind the eight-ball. How should he proceed? Here we return to the lesson that Trump has to teach Biden about life in hyperpolarized politics.  To wit: blitz. Do everything at once. No matter what the Biden administration does, it will be accused of socialism and corruption by the right. And the past several years have richly demonstrated that conservative parts of the country, particularly rural areas and low-density suburbs, are almost completely captured by right-wing media, from Fox on the TV to AM conservative radio to Sinclair-owned local news to the profusion of shady Facebook sources and groups, where misinformation is rapid and rampant.  Democrats badly need to address this media asymmetry. Despite what conservatives have convinced themselves, mainstream media outlets like CNN are not analogous to Fox, and Democrats have no comparable radio, local TV, or social media operations to carry their messages and narratives straight to voters where they live.  But that is long-term work, and 2022 is right around the corner.  The only thing Biden will have real control over is his administration and what it does. And his North Star, his organizing principle, should be doing as much good on as many fronts as fast as possible. Blitz. By constantly blundering forward, Trump has helped chart which US institutions and norms provide real resistance and which don\u2019t. The courts have tangibly restrained Trump; they have been the primary bulwark against him. But the chattering of the media and the political classes? Moral outrage? Precedent and tradition? Civil protest?  All of these have proven gossamer. Trump charged right through them like they were cotton candy. By constantly acting, being on the offensive, generating new stories and controversies, he simply overwhelmed the ability of the system to fasten on any one thing.  Biden should learn the lesson. All that matters is what gets done, put on paper and into law. The rest is vapor. The administration should staff up as rapidly as possible with ambitious young progressives and tell every single civil servant that the next two years are going to be a full sprint. Start immediately rewriting and reimplementing the environmental, public health, and worker safety regulations Trump has weakened. Reverse his immigration policies. Drop his lawsuits.  Reassess the social cost of carbon. Replace Trump\u2019s weak Affordable Clean Energy rule with more stringent carbon rules for the power sector. Ditch EPA\u2019s \u201csecret science\u201d rule and restock scientific advisory boards with actual scientists. Put a moratorium on new oil and gas drilling leases on public land. Pledge the purchasing power of the federal government \u2014 around $500 billion a year \u2014 toward clean energy technology.  Through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), direct federal financing toward carbon reduction and clean energy across agencies. Use the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to reject regulations from any agency that do not include both a climate and equity \u201cscreen\u201d to ensure that they reduce emissions and help the most vulnerable. Use the powers conferred by the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill to integrate climate risks into the financial system.  I\u2019ve written more about what Biden can do on climate change without Congress. Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews took a wider policy view with 10 big things Biden can do with executive powers, from forgiving student loan debt to reigning in factory farming. More ideas can be found here, here, here, and here, among other places. There\u2019s no shortage of ways for Biden to deploy the powers of the presidency, and he should maximize every one of them. All of these moves will elicit howls of outrage and court challenges from the right. Many will also infuriate the left, since they will inevitably fall short of Biden\u2019s grand campaign promises.  Biden can\u2019t control any of that. Doing less, negotiating more, relying on clever sequencing, chasing after receding promises of cooperation \u2014 none of that will solve anything, any more than it did for Obama. He can reach across the aisle, make it clear his door is open, but he shouldn\u2019t wait around for anyone to walk in. Biden\u2019s best chance is to try to overwhelm the system the way Trump did, by doing so much that it\u2019s impossible to make any one thing into a lasting story. He should launch so many simultaneous reforms that there\u2019s no time for right-wing media to make up lies about all of them or for the Supreme Court to hear them all. He should ignore bad-faith attacks and stay relentlessly on message about what\u2019s gotten done and what\u2019s getting done next. He should, at every juncture, get caught trying to make government work better for ordinary people. To succeed, all this must happen alongside Democratic Party efforts to improve messaging and media, get persistent party infrastructure on the ground in communities the party has neglected, and innovate on voter outreach and persuasion. (Aaron Strauss has some good ideas on that front.) But Biden has something the rest of the party at the federal level does not have: the power to improve Americans\u2019 lives in a visible way. More than anything else, cynicism about government\u2019s ability to do that is corroding US politics. The best thing Biden can do, morally and politically, is act, as much and as fast as possible, and then talk about it, and do more of it, and talk about it more. (And he should be clear about exactly who stands in the way of bigger, better changes, and why his name is Mitch McConnell.) The rest of it, he should ignore: the Washington chatter about the latest Republican accusations or catty infighting among Democratic factions, the cable news story or Twitter drama of the day, the latest offensive thing Trump or some Trump surrogate said, all of it. Bulldoze through it. The president has limited ability to control political discourse and drama, but he has an enormous capacity to change policy and direct resources. Biden should use that power while he has it, without hesitation or apology.",

    "article_text": "4 looming foreign policy crises that could derail Biden\u2019s agenda early on President-elect Joe Biden may want his administration to focus on long-term issues like the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, rebuilding alliances, and America\u2019s relationship with China, but some key near-term foreign policy problems will likely require his attention first. After the assassination of its top nuclear scientist by an unknown attacker, Iran might be less willing to engage in diplomacy with America and instead seek revenge by targeting US officials. North Korea could test an intercontinental ballistic missile early in Biden\u2019s term to try to gauge the new administration\u2019s response. The last remaining nuclear arms control deal between the US and Russia is set to expire just over two weeks after Biden takes office. And the reduced number of American troops in Afghanistan could derail sputtering peace talks and worsen the country\u2019s security situation.  Such a dilemma wouldn\u2019t be unique to Biden. Every new president comes in with ideas on how to handle larger global problems, only to have the colloquial \u201ctyranny of the inbox\u201d monopolize their time. \u201cIf you assume that foreign policy is less than half, and maybe a quarter, of the president\u2019s time, then that really shines a light on how serious this inbox problem is,\u201d said Christopher Preble, co-director of the New American Engagement Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank. Once he\u2019s in the Oval Office, then, Biden will likely find his hopes of tackling grander foreign policy challenges dashed by the effort he\u2019ll have to expend cleaning up more immediate messes. What follows is what four of those messes could look like. The 2015 nuclear agreement among Iran, the US, European powers, Russia, and China put tight restrictions on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The Obama administration\u2019s goal was to block Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear weapon diplomatically instead of by military force. But President Donald Trump withdrew America from the deal in 2018, reimposed financial penalties on Iran, and asked European countries to cease their business with the country. That kicked off a years-long cycle of escalations that, among other things, has seen Iran stockpile 12 times the amount of low-enriched uranium the deal allowed and the assassinations of two prominent Iranian officials. The first took place in January, when the US killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s paramilitary forces and one of the most powerful men in the country. Iran promised to exact a \u201charsher revenge\u201d in response; so far, that revenge has consisted mostly of attacks on US forces and assets by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq.  The second killing happened last Friday, when the mastermind behind Iran\u2019s nuclear program, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was fatally shot inside his vehicle near Tehran, reportedly with a remote-controlled weapon. No one has publicly claimed responsibility for the attack, but Israel has been suspected of orchestrating similar assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists in the past. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has already blamed Israel for it \u2014 and added his own threat. \u201cIran will surely respond to the martyrdom of our scientist at the proper time,\u201d he said in a Saturday speech. If Iran were to respond to these assassinations by escalating attacks on US personnel in Iraq or by attempting to assassinate US or Israeli officials, it would pose a major challenge for a Biden administration.  \u201cCertainly a retaliation that led to the killing of an American in a theater like Iraq would create serious complications for the Biden team,\u201d said Dalia Dassa Kaye, a Middle East expert at the RAND Corporation. The president-elect has often stated that America\u2019s commitment to Israel will remain \u201cironclad\u201d under his presidency. If Iran were to directly or even indirectly attack Israel, Biden would be under a lot of pressure to support Jerusalem in some way.  All of this, of course, would lead the US and Iran further down the path toward war and away from a possible diplomatic resolution. \u201cSuch responses are likely to undermine the chances for diplomacy with Biden and easing of US sanctions,\u201d Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told me.  However, Iran could use the threat of an attack as a pressure tool, she continued. \u201cIran could instead hold back its retaliatory moves \u2014 maintaining it will respond at a time and place of its choosing. This way Iran has some more bargaining chips when it comes to potential future talks with the Biden administration and Europeans.\u201d What Iran does or doesn\u2019t do in the coming months, then, could greatly impact Biden\u2019s grander foreign policy plans. As the oft-quoted saying goes: \u201cThe enemy gets a vote.\u201d Within the first few months of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, North Korea tested a long-range missile and a nuclear device. And in Trump\u2019s first year in charge, Pyongyang test-launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and tested its most powerful nuclear bomb to date. Some experts warn that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may make similar provocative moves in the early stages of a Biden administration. \u201cNorth Korea is one of those challenges that no one really wants to deal with right now, since there are no easy solutions or pathways to slowing down the growth of the program. But Kim has a way of putting himself back on the high-priority list,\u201d said Vipin Narang, an expert on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program at MIT. There are many ways Kim could do that, but one in particular stands out: He could conduct the first test of the new ICBMs he displayed during an October parade.  Those missiles were not only the biggest ever seen in North Korea\u2019s arsenal, experts also said they were the largest road-mobile missiles with their own truck-based launchers in the world. In case of a war, then, North Korea\u2019s military could roll these missiles out of underground bunkers, place them somewhere on land, and shoot them at the United States.  A test simulating that kind of launch would rank among the most threatening actions ever taken by Pyongyang \u2014 surely ratcheting up tensions with the US in the process. The new missiles haven\u2019t been tested yet, though, and they may have issues North Korea still needs to fix.  That\u2019s why many experts predict Pyongyang will probably test one in early 2021, in part to see how it goes and in part to send a message to Biden: North Korea is a nuclear power, and you can\u2019t do anything about it. Such a provocative move would require some sort of response from the Biden administration. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean war, said Elizabeth Saunders, a US foreign policy expert at Georgetown University. But it could mean more sanctions on North Korea, reinstating US military drills with South Korea, sending more US warships to the area, or all of the above.  Figuring out the best response could take up a lot of time and energy early in Biden\u2019s term, leaving less time and energy to address some of his longer-term policy objectives. New START, short for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, is a nuclear arms control agreement signed between the US and Russia in 2011. The pact limits the size of the two countries\u2019 nuclear arsenals, which together account for 93 percent of all nuclear warheads on earth. The problem is that the deal \u2014 the last major arms control accord between Washington and Moscow still in effect \u2014 is set to expire on February 5, 2021. That gives Biden just 16 days after becoming president to extend the pact. Biden has committed to extending New START, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he wants to extend it for at least one year. Most experts believe Biden and Putin will swiftly extend the agreement before the deadline. \u201cMy impression is that Russia still regards an extension of New START as being in their interest,\u201d said Sarah Bidgood, an expert on Russia\u2019s nuclear program at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies.  But the short timeline could give Moscow an advantage to extract some early concessions from the Biden administration before greenlighting an extension. The Kremlin, experts say, could demand Biden lift Trump-imposed sanctions on the country, or ask that the US make a statement praising Russia\u2019s military presence in Nagorno-Karabakh to keep the peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It\u2019s unclear if such requests would truly be of the take-it-or-leave-it variety. Moscow might want to see what it could get, if anything, before agreeing to an extension. Still, such a move could take the US and Russia to the brink of losing New START and decades of arms control efforts along with it. What\u2019s more, Bidgood said, a tough negotiation could follow after the extension, especially if Washington and Moscow don\u2019t prolong New START for the full five years allowed under the deal. The potential for nuclear-related trouble with Russia right at the start of a new administration, then, could be a time suck for the Biden administration. With just two months left in office, the Trump administration is rushing to wind down the 19-year US war in Afghanistan by cutting the number of US troops in the country from 4,500 to 2,500 by January 15 \u2014 five days before Biden is to be sworn in. But while many on both the left and the right in the US support bringing that war to an end, experts worry such a quick withdrawal will harm America\u2019s interests in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a less responsible way to withdraw,\u201d Jason Dempsey, a former Army infantry officer who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, told me earlier this month. The main concern is what leaving so abruptly means for America\u2019s diplomatic pact with the Taliban. The deal both parties signed earlier this year said all US troops had to leave by May 2021, assuming conditions in the country are relatively peaceful and the Taliban has upheld its end of the deal, which includes engaging in peace talks with the Afghan government and not attacking international forces. Those peace talks began in September but are not going very well \u2014 not least because Taliban fighters have increased their attacks on Afghan security forces and civilians across the country in recent months. Dempsey, who\u2019s now at the Center for a New American Security think tank, said pulling more US troops out of the country as those negotiations proceed could hurt Kabul\u2019s negotiating position and encourage even more Taliban attacks. \u201cGiving away any leverage you have as you leave is a pretty stupid way to go about it,\u201d he told me. The question is what Biden would do with the forces Trump plans to leave him with. The president-elect has said he wants to keep at least some troops in Afghanistan to serve as a counterterrorism force, so it\u2019s possible he may not change anything when he takes office in January. But if the smaller US presence emboldens the Taliban to ask for more in diplomatic talks with the Afghan government, or even attempt a forcible takeover of the Afghan government \u2014 as it did in 1996 \u2014 then the Biden administration might have to scramble to back its ally in Kabul. That could potentially lead the new president to escalate the war in the country, thereby turning much of his time and attention away from other projects to focus on an old one.       ",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the election result has sputtered out President Donald Trump still has not conceded his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden, but his bid to overturn the election results has sputtered out over the past week. The lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors. Trump is still, of course, trying his best to cast doubt on the results by making false claims of large-scale voter fraud. His latest gimmick is that his legal team is working with sympathetic Republican legislators in key states to hold press events touting supposed election irregularities. But no GOP-controlled legislature in a state Biden won seems to be making a serious push to overturn the result (a move that would entail many practical and legal obstacles). But the deadline in federal law for states to finalize their results is December 8 \u2014 Tuesday of next week. Then, the members of the Electoral College will meet (separately in each state) to cast their votes on December 14 \u2014 in just under two weeks. They are set to cast the votes that will officially make Biden the next president. And Trump has not yet been able to succeed in interfering with that process. There were six key swing states where Biden won by small margins, where Trump had hoped to interfere with the certification of results (certification is when a state makes its results official). Four of those six states \u2014 Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada \u2014 certified their results over the past week and a half, with Biden as the winner. The fifth and sixth, Arizona and Wisconsin, certified Biden\u2019s victory on Monday. Trump made political, procedural, and legal attempts to try and delay or interfere with these certifications, but these efforts have uniformly failed. Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, spurned the Trump team\u2019s attempts to get him to endorse fictitious claims of widespread voter fraud in the state. In Michigan, Trump allies\u2019 attempts to get two Republicans on the state board of canvassers to  block certification for similar reasons failed last week (one of them backed it).  In most of the other states, the key officials in charge of certifying results were Democrats, so Trump could only hope that a judge would step in and block certification. None have \u2014 so the Trump team\u2019s lawsuits flopped. Recounts have also failed to change the outcome. Wisconsin\u2019s recount of two counties has concluded, and Biden\u2019s lead of about 20,000 votes expanded by 87 votes. Georgia\u2019s new machine recount is still ongoing, but it isn\u2019t expected to change Biden\u2019s 12,000-vote lead since the ballots have already been audited by hand. After states certify their results, the next step in the process is that the electors are appointed. And this is key \u2014 the electors are the 538 people who compose the Electoral College and cast the votes that will officially determine the next president.  If Biden wins a state, he is entitled to have his chosen slate of people appointed as the electors for that state. But some Republicans have embraced the theory that the Constitution empowers state legislatures to ignore the outcome of the vote in their states and appoint whoever they want as electors instead.  Any effort to do this would run afoul of various state laws and arguably federal law as well. Legislators would essentially be asserting that the power granted them by the Constitution allows them to ignore these existing laws.  Some GOP state legislators have indeed come out in support of this, such as Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano (who met with Trump last week before abruptly leaving the meeting after he was informed he had tested positive for Covid-19). But GOP state legislative leaders have not come out in support of this effort, and most have outright said they won\u2019t. Pennsylvania\u2019s legislative leaders have no plans to put this on their legislative agenda. And Michigan\u2019s Republican leaders left a meeting with Trump earlier this month and said they would \u201cfollow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan\u2019s electors.\u201d And even though Trump\u2019s legal team worked with allied legislators in Pennsylvania and Arizona to hold purported \u201chearings\u201d about election irregularities in recent days, those weren\u2019t official legislative hearings \u2014 they were essentially press stunts.  So with neither the officials in charge of certifications nor Republican state legislative leaders willing to try to steal the election for Trump, it looks like the president\u2019s attempt to do just that is dead in the water.

    "article_text": "Joe Biden announces Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary pick In 2014, Janet Yellen became the first woman to be named chair of the Federal Reserve. Six years later, she is poised to become the first woman Treasury secretary of the United States. On Monday, President-elect Joe Biden announced that he intends to nominate Yellen, 74, to head the Treasury Department; he also announced his picks for a number of other key members of his economic team. The Yellen choice was widely reported last week. Biden\u2019s pick is not necessarily a surprising one. In the days leading up to the decision, Biden said his nominee would be someone who \u201cwill be accepted by all elements of the Democratic Party \u2026 progressive to the moderate coalitions,\u201d leading to broad speculation that it would be Yellen, who most Democrats are expected to support and who many Republicans could have a hard time opposing. In a tweet on Monday \u2014 her first \u2014 Yellen said the country faces \u201cgreat challenges\u201d at the moment. \u201cTo recover, we must restore the American dream \u2014 a society where each person can rise to their potential and dream even bigger for their children,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs Treasury Secretary, I will work every day towards rebuilding that dream for all.\u201d Yellen, who is originally from Brooklyn, New York, served as chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018 before President Donald Trump decided to replace her with current Chair Jerome Powell. She previously served as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton, and was a longtime professor at the University of California Berkeley. \u201cYellen is eminently qualified, she oversaw a sprawling bureaucracy at the Fed. It would be incredibly difficult for various factions [Republicans, moderate Democrats, and progressive Democrats] to find issue with her tenure,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research and Trading. \u201cI don\u2019t think she would make any side happy, per se, but she certainly wouldn\u2019t make either side unhappy, and that might be as good as we can get.\u201d As Fed chair, Yellen oversaw the continued recovery from the Great Recession and left behind a solid legacy. Unemployment declined steadily, the stock market climbed, and inflation stayed low under her tenure. Part of the strong economy Trump inherited can be traced back to Yellen. That\u2019s not to say Yellen\u2019s time at the Fed was perfect. As Sam Bell outlined in Politico in 2018, some people say that she was \u201ctoo sanguine\u201d about the potential for using regulations to stave off the next financial crisis, that she went too easy on Wells Fargo in the wake of its fake accounts scandal, or that she didn\u2019t do enough to help smaller banks. \u201cAnd yet on the critical issue at hand in her 2014 nomination \u2014 could we bring more unemployed workers back into the labor force without blowing things up for everyone? \u2014 she has been unquestionably vindicated,\u201d Bell wrote. Some people have also questioned the Fed\u2019s decision to modestly raise interest rates under Yellen\u2019s tenure, arguing that doing so prevented the economy from reaching its full potential and getting more people into the workforce. Of course, hindsight is 20/20. And at the Treasury Department, Yellen won\u2019t have anything to do with interest rate decisions. \u201cJust as she shied away from fiscal policy when she ran monetary policy, I think she\u2019d shy away from monetary policy as Treasury secretary,\u201d Boltansky said. Progressives have also raised questions about her previous comments regarding the deficit, which she described as unsustainable.  Biden also revealed a number of other nominees for his economic team on Monday, including Center for American Progress president and CEO Neera Tanden for director of the Office of Management and Budget, labor economist and Princeton School of Public and International Affairs dean Cecilia Rouse for chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Obama Foundation president Wally Adeyemo for deputy Treasury secretary. Biden said he will appoint his longtime adviser Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, president and CEO of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, to serve on the Council of Economic Advisers. Other contenders on the shortlist for the Treasury spot included former Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin; current Fed governor Lael Brainard; and Roger Ferguson, the CEO of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA), a financial services company, among others. Heading the Treasury Department is an important job \u2014 the department oversees the IRS; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which charters, regulates, and supervises national banks; and the US Mint, among other bureaus \u2014 and the secretary plays a key role in advising the president on economic issues.  Leading up to Biden\u2019s announcement, there was quite a bit of back-and-forth among more moderate and progressive Democrats regarding who the Treasury pick should be. Progressives championed figures such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Raskin, and pushed Biden to eschew anyone with perceived industry or Wall Street ties. Moderates, on the other hand, hoped for a figure viewed as less divisive than Warren, more along the lines of Ferguson or Brainard. But it is important to remember that the person chosen to run the Treasury Department reflects the Biden administration\u2019s priorities, not the other way around, and will likely be in lockstep with the White House\u2019s positioning on key issues. \u201cThe Treasury secretary and Biden will, at least publicly, be on the same page and deliver the same message,\u201d wrote Ian Katz, director at Capital Alpha Partners, in a recent note to investors. \u201cYou will not see Biden, for example, criticizing sanctions against other countries that the Treasury Department is working on.\u201d At least initially, that will mean the new secretary will work with Biden on his top priority: addressing the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to remake Treasury in their own image, Treasury will still be forced to triage, as every agency will, in fighting the virus,\u201d Boltansky said. \u201cWhoever\u2019s in that role, they\u2019re going to be a virus-fighter first and a treasury secretary second.\u201d This could translate to the secretary trying to negotiate a new stimulus package with Congress, as current Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has done, to little success, under Trump. It could also mean an effort to refocus the department on renewing CARES Act programs, like restarting Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans for small businesses. Mnuchin recently decided to end lending programs put in place through the CARES Act, and asked the Fed to return funds earmarked for those programs. Biden\u2019s team has been critical of the move. If those programs are restarted under the Biden administration \u2014 something that will become tougher if the funds are returned before Inauguration Day \u2014 the new secretary could oversee those as well.  Biden has also emphasized the importance of reasserting America\u2019s presence on the international stage, and Treasury has a role to play there. One can expect more attention to the international arena from a Biden Treasury Department than from Trump\u2019s, and an effort to reaffirm international relationships. It\u2019s possible, too, that the Treasury secretary (or other members of the administration) could wind up playing multiple roles through the Vacancies Act, should Biden struggle to get his choices through the Senate confirmation process. Trump employed this strategy often, like when then-White House budget director Mick Mulvaney was acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If confirmed, Yellen will find herself in one of the most powerful governmental positions within the American economy yet again, though in a different role. And she is expected to be particularly influential in the role. \u201cThough all of the contenders [for Biden\u2019s Treasury pick] would have Biden\u2019s ear, we think Yellen\u2019s voice would carry the most weight with the president and his advisers,\u201d Katz wrote. \u201cNot many people in the White House would want to debate economics with Yellen.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the election result has sputtered out President Donald Trump still has not conceded his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden, but his bid to overturn the election results has sputtered out over the past week. The lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors. Trump is still, of course, trying his best to cast doubt on the results by making false claims of large-scale voter fraud. His latest gimmick is that his legal team is working with sympathetic Republican legislators in key states to hold press events touting supposed election irregularities. But no GOP-controlled legislature in a state Biden won seems to be making a serious push to overturn the result (a move that would entail many practical and legal obstacles). But the deadline in federal law for states to finalize their results is December 8 \u2014 Tuesday of next week. Then, the members of the Electoral College will meet (separately in each state) to cast their votes on December 14 \u2014 in just under two weeks. They are set to cast the votes that will officially make Biden the next president. And Trump has not yet been able to succeed in interfering with that process. There were six key swing states where Biden won by small margins, where Trump had hoped to interfere with the certification of results (certification is when a state makes its results official). Four of those six states \u2014 Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada \u2014 certified their results over the past week and a half, with Biden as the winner. The fifth and sixth, Arizona and Wisconsin, certified Biden\u2019s victory on Monday. Trump made political, procedural, and legal attempts to try and delay or interfere with these certifications, but these efforts have uniformly failed. Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, spurned the Trump team\u2019s attempts to get him to endorse fictitious claims of widespread voter fraud in the state. In Michigan, Trump allies\u2019 attempts to get two Republicans on the state board of canvassers to  block certification for similar reasons failed last week (one of them backed it).  In most of the other states, the key officials in charge of certifying results were Democrats, so Trump could only hope that a judge would step in and block certification. None have \u2014 so the Trump team\u2019s lawsuits flopped. Recounts have also failed to change the outcome. Wisconsin\u2019s recount of two counties has concluded, and Biden\u2019s lead of about 20,000 votes expanded by 87 votes. Georgia\u2019s new machine recount is still ongoing, but it isn\u2019t expected to change Biden\u2019s 12,000-vote lead since the ballots have already been audited by hand. After states certify their results, the next step in the process is that the electors are appointed. And this is key \u2014 the electors are the 538 people who compose the Electoral College and cast the votes that will officially determine the next president.  If Biden wins a state, he is entitled to have his chosen slate of people appointed as the electors for that state. But some Republicans have embraced the theory that the Constitution empowers state legislatures to ignore the outcome of the vote in their states and appoint whoever they want as electors instead.  Any effort to do this would run afoul of various state laws and arguably federal law as well. Legislators would essentially be asserting that the power granted them by the Constitution allows them to ignore these existing laws.  Some GOP state legislators have indeed come out in support of this, such as Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano (who met with Trump last week before abruptly leaving the meeting after he was informed he had tested positive for Covid-19). But GOP state legislative leaders have not come out in support of this effort, and most have outright said they won\u2019t. Pennsylvania\u2019s legislative leaders have no plans to put this on their legislative agenda. And Michigan\u2019s Republican leaders left a meeting with Trump earlier this month and said they would \u201cfollow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan\u2019s electors.\u201d And even though Trump\u2019s legal team worked with allied legislators in Pennsylvania and Arizona to hold purported \u201chearings\u201d about election irregularities in recent days, those weren\u2019t official legislative hearings \u2014 they were essentially press stunts.  So with neither the officials in charge of certifications nor Republican state legislative leaders willing to try to steal the election for Trump, it looks like the president\u2019s attempt to do just that is dead in the water.

    "article_text": "What happened to Democrats in North Carolina: \u201cIt was a total effort that failed down ballot\u201d North Carolina Democrats and progressive organizers this year had hoped for a repeat of the 2008 election, when Democrats won in the state up and down the ballot. Instead, they saw several victories for Republicans. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win the presidency,\u201d said Robert Dawkins, the political director of Action NC, an advocacy group focused on anti-poverty initiatives and voter outreach. \u201cWe didn\u2019t gain any progressive seats in the House, state Senate; most of the black candidates that ran for judges didn\u2019t win. It was a total effort that failed down ballot.\u201d Ahead of Election Day, polls projected positive results for Democrats in North Carolina \u2014 on November 3, President-elect Joe Biden led President Donald Trump in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s state polling average by 1.8 percentage points, Democratic US Senate candidate Cal Cunningham led incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis by anywhere from 2 to 6 percentage points, and incumbent Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper was regularly recorded as having double-digit support. Of the three, only Cooper won, and by 4.52 percentage points. Biden lost by 1.34 percentage points, Cunningham by 1.74 percentage points, and Republicans maintained control of the state legislature. The losses for Democrats weren\u2019t due to low turnout; in fact, turnout was up, with 75 percent of eligible voters \u2014 5.54 million people \u2014 casting ballots. According to the North Carolina state board of elections, Democrats expanded their voter base by nearly 500,000 compared to 2016, while Republicans gained about 400,000 more voters. And a Carolina Population Center analysis found about 1.8 million new voters (Democratic, Republican, and unaffiliated) registered compared to 2016. There was expanded access to polling sites, with early voting locations being added in cities and efforts to facilitate transportation for those lacking it on Election Day. A number of activists told me there were fewer instances of outright voter suppression than had been feared, and that wait times to cast ballots generally weren\u2019t long.  None of that was enough, however. Many I spoke to in the state said they believe the results showed the problem was not about enthusiasm or turnout, but about strategy, difficulty overcoming the consequences of past elections, and, most importantly, timing.  Unlike North Carolina, Biden was able to win in Georgia, defeating Trump by 0.25 percentage points. According to activists and organizers in North Carolina, the difference between the two states was at least partly self-inflicted. Take Democrats\u2019 outreach strategy in each state: Dawkins said Georgia deftly implemented a policy-centric approach that could have been employed more effectively in North Carolina. \u201cIn Georgia, from the start of the new year in January, everything, every campaign, if they were talking about why a neighborhood needs a speed bump, it was, \u2018It\u2019s not going to change until you register to vote. And here\u2019s a card, register to vote,\u2019\u201d Dawkins said. \u201cIt was surgical.\u201d A similar strategy led to Democrats\u2019 last big win in North Carolina in 2008, according to Dawkins. That year, the Democratic Party won the presidency, a US Senate race, the governor\u2019s chair, and maintained control of the state\u2019s General Assembly.  Dawkins said that year, \u201cI don\u2019t care if we\u2019re talking about a pothole, or I don\u2019t care if we\u2019re talking about the light rail here, or whatever it was, got tied to, \u2018And we need to vote to get this man in office.\u2019\u201d That year, Barack Obama was on the ballot, and this method of winning votes was made easier by the enthusiasm created by his candidacy. This time, voters weren\u2019t quite as animated by their choices.  Ahead of the election, Kevin Jones, the first vice chair of the Nash County Democratic Party, told me he was concerned about the level of enthusiasm for the Democrats on the ballot, particularly Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf Donald Trump needs 15 electoral votes to win the presidency and it comes down to one vote in North Carolina, it won\u2019t be my vote that gets him in there. But, you know, I don\u2019t feel too good about it.\u201d But there remains a sense that a different strategy could have overcome that gap. Obama wasn\u2019t on the ballot in Georgia this year either, and the state nevertheless flipped blue for the first time in nearly 30 years. Bennett Carpenter, the lead organizer for the progressive political group Durham for All, said his organization worked to highlight how Democratic policies would help voters \u2014 and saw success with it.  \u201cPeople are so clear, especially in this moment, on the issues facing our communities, they\u2019re loud and obvious,\u201d Carpenter said. Acknowledging that many in their community are frustrated with a lack of progress on those issues, Carpenter added that Durham for All saw success in \u201csharing messaging around, \u2018We can make change happen, we can work together\u2019 ... it\u2019s a bridge to bring people over kind of the arc from disillusionment to hope and possibility.\u201d  But Dawkins believes it should have been executed more broadly. Marcus Bass, the executive director of Advance Carolina, a progressive advocacy group focused on empowering Black communities, said he saw the problem as coming from the top. He believes that the national Democratic Party\u2019s \u201coffering of the Trump-or-else ticket, without really providing a deep response to some of these longstanding issues, hurt the efforts of turnout in North Carolina.\u201d  And Todd Zimmer, co-director of the rural progressive advocacy group Down Home North Carolina, noted that Democrats\u2019 single statewide success, the reelection of Gov. Roy Cooper, can be seen as a testament to the effectiveness of a policy-centric approach.  \u201cCooper has shown that he will fight for Medicaid expansion, that he\u2019ll stand up, even if he can\u2019t win that fight with a divided General Assembly,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI think he was rewarded by North Carolina voters because he\u2019s seen as someone who understands how important that issue is ... [and] his response also surely helped. Because North Carolinians approve of his handling of the coronavirus and oppose the reopen movement, by and large.\u201d A number of organizers also said Democrats hurt themselves. Organizers in many swing states have complained post-election that the Democratic Party relied too heavily on consultants and operatives from outside their states \u2014 and I heard similar lamentations about the national party\u2019s strategy in North Carolina.  Bass argued party leaders miscalculated in hoping the top of the ticket would buoy down-ballot candidates. And while national leaders were generally given credit for investing in the state, North Carolina organizers said that money was often not used wisely and that staff and consultants arrived too late in the year, with too little understanding of the communities they\u2019d been embedded in to do much good.  The issue, they said, and as Florida state Sen. Annette Taddeo told Politico, is that \u201cyou can\u2019t just show up a month before the election and expect people to be excited to vote for you.\u201d  Perhaps the most important issue was one of time, according to many organizers. They said flipping North Carolina can and will happen, once they\u2019ve had a few more years to do so. Durham for All was limited in part by being a relatively new organization, Carpenter said \u2014 it was founded only four years ago. Down Home North Carolina is about three years old. And many of the progressive organizations they partner with are around the same age or newer. \u201cIn the places where we\u2019re really building that infrastructure, I think we\u2019re seeing real gains,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cA lesson to me is that that infrastructure takes time and resources and permanent year-round work.\u201d Carpenter said the hope is that in four years, with continued work and engagement, the results of North Carolina\u2019s elections will be radically different. And in Georgia, organizers told me that time \u2014 coupled with consistent work \u2014 was the secret to their success. Deborah Scott, the executive director of Georgia Stand-Up told Vox\u2019s Anna North that turning Georgia blue was a 15-year effort.  As Lewanna Heard-Tucker, chair of Georgia\u2019s Fulton County Democrats, told me, \u201cAt the end of the day, this has been a long time coming for Georgia. It didn\u2019t just happen overnight.\u201d While there are certainly opportunities Democrats and organizers can continue to pursue, their efforts were also complicated by factors outside of their control. Chief among these was the coronavirus pandemic, which forced organizers and party officials to scrap their plans for registration and motivation and to hastily come up with new strategies.  \u201cRight when we started [outreach efforts] Covid hit, which threw a wrench in some of our plans, particularly because our initial plan had been really focused on door-knocking as the way that you can really meet people where they\u2019re at and build relationships,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cAnd so right from jump, we had to really switch to primarily phone-banking and text-banking and from in-person events to virtual.\u201d For Durham for All, those efforts were more effective than they might have hoped. And Bass noted that while the pandemic made organizing difficult, it allowed Advance Carolina to engage in ways it might not otherwise have been able to. \u201cTaking us out of physical spaces,\u201d said Bass, \u201chelped build a broader base, in some cases, where groups that typically would just be meeting in private spaces now are online.\u201d But for other organizations, the transition was more difficult. Zimmer said Down Home North Carolina moved to a \u201crelational turnout model\u201d where about 800 leaders were given access to an app to help support them in outreach to friends, family, and others they had personal relationships with. The organization also moved an outreach strategy based around conversations on race and class it had planned to use in person to the phones.  \u201cI think that was to our disadvantage, frankly,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI think that those tactics are powerful and strong, but that doors is a really important part of our electoral process. And so I wish we could have a do-over and could be on doors.\u201d And Dawkins noted that many other organizations struggled as they \u201cdrastically moved off of a tried-and-true and proven method of door contact and phone-banking and switched over to more mobile mobilization work, which I don\u2019t think paid off.\u201d Much of that mobile mobilization work consisted of \u201cwhat we call souls to the polls,\u201d Dawkins said \u2014 meaning organizations worked with pastors and other community leaders to put together marches to polling places. \u201cThat drastically hurt,\u201d Dawkins told me, \u201cbecause what you found was the people that were showing up and taking part in these marches to the polls and souls to the polls were people that were already gonna vote.\u201d Because of pandemic- and funding-related challenges, Action NC was ultimately not able to match its normal level of voter engagement. \u201cNormally we shoot to register between 15,000 and 20,000 people a year. This year, we reregistered 6,500. So that was a big hit,\u201d Dawkins said. Still, statewide, registration was up, buoyed in part by the state\u2019s nearly 400,000 new residents since 2016. Turnout increased dramatically as well. In the rural communities Down Home North Carolina serves, Zimmer said, \u201cin a lot of cases [there was] an over 100 percent increase versus \u201916.\u201d Overall, Carpenter said, \u201cWe brought 100,000 more folks into the races than the right wing did, which meant that when it comes to statewide races, we were able to really narrow the gap \u2014 but still not close it.\u201d Closing that gap was complicated in part by the past. While Democrats won resoundingly in 2008, they lost badly in 2010, when Republicans took control of the North Carolina\u2019s General Assembly. These lawmakers oversaw redistricting after the 2010 census, redrawing maps to benefit the GOP \u2014 first along racial lines and then along partisan lines after their initial effort was invalidated by the US Supreme Court for diluting the voting power of Black North Carolinians. In 2012, a Republican governor won, giving the GOP complete control of the state. New voting constraints, including a voter ID law, followed in 2013. These were struck down in 2016 by the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals for targeting \u201cAfrican Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d A modified version of the voter ID law was then instated via ballot measure in 2018. It\u2019s currently being fought in court \u2014 and as a result, was not in effect for the 2020 election. Nevertheless, this reality made it feel as though Democrats and organizers for progressive causes were playing against a stacked deck, their voting power diluted and many citizens unsure of whether they had the documents needed to vote. Carpenter said it \u201cfor sure\u201d hurt Democrats in the most recent election.  Many organizers, like Carpenter, see the 2020 election as the catalyst for greater change in the state and the start of years of organizing work and court battles in order to make North Carolina more competitive for Democrats. Legal challenges to the state\u2019s voter ID law are set to continue in state and federal court \u2014 and advocates hope to lobby for greater access to voter registration. For example, online voter registration was made available this cycle for North Carolinians with driver\u2019s licenses, a policy change Carpenter called \u201can improvement that still didn\u2019t fully address the structural barriers that prevent particularly people of color, poor working-class people, and young people from registering and voting.\u201d Expanding that access would make registering new voters easier ahead of the 2022 races. Carpenter also spoke of working to expand Democrats\u2019 voter base. Biden was clearly able to grow his base of support in historically Democratic counties but struggled more to flip back Obama-voting counties Trump won in 2016. In many of those, Trump built upon his 2016 vote totals; for example, in Robeson County, which Trump swung by 21 percentage points in 2016, he beat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by 4 percentage points. In 2020, he defeated Biden there by 18.6 percentage points. \u201cIf I have a takeaway from this election, it\u2019s that we need to continue to do work to persuade people who might be voting for Trump that actually, our politics offers them a better path towards a more hopeful and prosperous and happier future,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI think we need to have the audacity to believe that our vision can be more powerful and more compelling than the siren call of white supremacy.\u201d Perhaps the most immediately pressing issue for organizers and Democrats will be the fact that the GOP will retain control of the General Assembly.  When the new districts are drawn following the release of the 2020 census results, Republican lawmakers are likely to attempt to neutralize Democratic power in places where Biden significantly increased his vote share over Clinton, like Wake County, and to minimize the role new Democratic state residents have on elections. Dawkins said he and other activists expect to \u201cgo back to court and fight over that.\u201d  That means in the short term, organizers and local Democratic officials need to play where they can win, Carpenter said, adding that the key question is, \u201cHow can we actually be mobilizing for real change in the places where we do have decisive governing power as we\u2019re continuing to build that grassroots infrastructure at the local level?\u201d And in the long term, Zimmer said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conversations happening in some of the spaces I\u2019m in right now about 10-year strategies because there\u2019s a sense that North Carolina will change but that we have to organize and build strategically in order to get there.\u201d For many I spoke to, that strategic building will involve outreach, education, pooling resources with like-minded organizations, and the careful recruitment of candidates that reflect the communities they are running in and that have a nuanced grasp of policy.  The ultimate goal, Carpenter said, is to be in a position \u201cfour years from now, eight years from now, where we\u2019re continuing to grow the movement, grow the leaders, grow the infrastructure that can not just win one election, but actually continue to win real change for North Carolina.\u201d ",

    "article_text": "Want to improve climate policy in the Biden era? Here\u2019s where to donate. Now that Joe Biden is the president-elect of the United States, the prospects of staving off total climate disaster look a little less dire. The Senate will likely constrain him \u2014 pending Georgia special elections, either the Republicans retain control of the Senate or the Democrats eke out a very narrow 50-50 majority and have to rely on centrists to get anything done \u2014 but there are still plenty of ways he can use his power to fight climate change.  The situation calls out for a potential change in approach if you\u2019re interested in donating to climate causes. In the past, there was reason to think that donating to US charities may not be the most cost-effective option \u2014 that, say, your dollars may go farther in developing countries working to preserve their rainforests.  But right now \u2014 and despite the logjam in federal climate policy \u2014 there really is a strong case for donating toward shifting US policy. Given that Biden campaigned on climate and has indicated that he\u2019s willing to make bold moves on that front, it\u2019s more likely now than it was under President Trump that donors can actually improve US climate policy by funding the right groups.   And now may be the most impactful time to donate. New leaders often do their most significant policy work in the first years of their presidency, so contributions made early in the Biden era can have an outsized impact when it comes to moving the needle on climate. And with Giving Tuesday coming up on December 1, some very wealthy folks are offering to match donations. But which are the most high-impact, cost-effective, evidence-based charities to donate to if you want to improve US climate policy? Your three best bets are the Clean Air Task Force, Carbon180, and the Sunrise Movement Education Fund.  These recommendations come from Founders Pledge and Giving Green, both groups that research the most effective charities and guide donors to give to them. Founders Pledge recommends the Clean Air Task Force and Carbon180, while Giving Green recommends the Clean Air Task Force and the Sunrise Movement Education Fund.  As you can see, there\u2019s overlap as well as divergence in these recommendations. And the divergence is instructive. It stems from the recommenders\u2019 differing assumptions about the best way to push forward climate policy under divided government: focusing on work that might have bipartisan appeal versus leaning into cultivating progressive grassroots activism. Johannes Ackva, the researcher who authored Founders Pledge\u2019s assessment, believes that now is a particularly important time to focus on advocacy that targets Washington lawmakers, rather than focusing on grassroots activism. He notes that the combo Americans are likely to end up with \u2014 a Democratic House and a Republican Senate \u2014 means lawmakers will need to craft climate proposals that Republicans can get behind. So he thinks people concerned about climate change need to respond to our new circumstances and change the typical approach. \u201cEspecially in light of the election result, we believe this kind of advocacy to be more impactful and more neglected than grassroots activism; right now, we need to be working to turn proposals and visions into politically feasible and effective policies,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe work of grassroots campaigners like the Sunrise Movement, which targets Democrats to encourage a more progressive climate agenda, likely won\u2019t be so impactful as the US needs bipartisan policy favorable to both parties.\u201d There\u2019s reason to be skeptical that the GOP will agree to any bipartisan climate deal; after all, this is the Mitch McConnell Senate we\u2019re likely talking about. And Ackva acknowledges that \u201cthe Democrats will probably need to compromise as their preferred climate policies are unlikely to pass through the Senate.\u201d But Republican intransigence on climate, Ackva suggests, is why our best bet is to fund organizations that know how to make inroads with Republicans, rather than ones that have strong ties only to Democrats. Doing that obviously doesn\u2019t guarantee any wins, but the claim is that failing to do that probably guarantees a loss. Ackva also thinks this kind of advocacy is relatively neglected, which means directing more dollars there stands to make a bigger impact than directing dollars to an area that\u2019s already getting funding and attention. This is why Founders Pledge recommends donating to the Clean Air Task Force and Carbon180. The former has a long history of successfully advocating for bipartisan climate policies under divided government. During the Bush years, for instance, it led a successful campaign to reduce the pollution caused by coal-fired power plants in the US and helped establish regulations of diesel, shipping, and methane emissions. It also runs a campaign to promote innovation on advanced nuclear energy, which could facilitate global decarbonization. Meanwhile, Carbon180 focuses on ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere, a neglected yet important piece of the climate puzzle. It has successfully lobbied for a tax credit for carbon capture and helped win increased funding for carbon removal research. And the organization is well connected among policy elites: It often briefs congressional staffers and provides input on legislation, and its executive director Noah Deich has just joined the transition team at the Department of Energy. Founders Pledge believes it\u2019s suited for the moment. Dan Stein, the director of Giving Green, an initiative at IDinsight, agrees that it\u2019s important to fund advocacy with bipartisan appeal \u2014 hence Giving Green\u2019s recommendation to donate to Clean Air Task Force.  But he also thinks it\u2019s important to fund grassroots activist groups.  \u201cI would push for a two-part strategy, because I think the way policy gets made is through these insider-outsider coalitions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have people with close links in the halls of Congress and to the president, and then you have external pressure that\u2019s forcing the politicians to pay attention to the issue. You see examples of this throughout history: In the civil rights movement, you had these pacts between [Martin Luther] King on the outside and Lyndon Johnson on the inside.\u201d  In addition to forcing Biden to keep prioritizing climate, activists can shift the Overton window, the range of policies that seem possible. Without a Democratic Senate, activists almost certainly won\u2019t succeed in getting a Green New Deal, but they can still continue pushing its policy ideas into the mainstream.  And while legislative climate policy will need Republican votes, there\u2019s also the executive branch, where Biden is going to have a lot of latitude to make policy changes through regulatory agencies.  \u201cA lot of the smart money is on most of the climate movement in the Biden administration happening through the executive branch. For that, you don\u2019t need bipartisanship,\u201d Stein said. \u201cSo the question there is who has the ear of the Biden administration. And I think that people like Sunrise [Education Fund] have the ear. They\u2019ve gotten that seat at the table.\u201d He elaborated on this in Giving Green\u2019s recommendation, noting: \u201cSunrise Movement Education Fund played a central role in building a strong coalition of politicians, activists, and researchers to coalesce around a policy framework generally known as \u2018Standards, Investment, and Justice.\u2019 This framework has been adopted by the House Select Committee on Climate Change and is integrated into the incoming Biden administration\u2019s climate plan.\u201d Giving Green says the Sunrise Movement Education Fund has been highly effective at growing its membership, but needs more funding to increase the size of its activist network so it can keep pushing for policy change.  Political scientists have lots of different theories of change, and they\u2019ll probably be debating which is right for a long, long time. Since we don\u2019t know for sure what\u2019s most effective at creating change in a political landscape like the one we\u2019re about to enter, it may make sense to support multiple evidence-based strategies simultaneously.   Hedging your bets by donating to more than one type of charity isn\u2019t always a sign of indecisiveness. It can also be a sign of intellectual humility. Whichever charity or charities you pick, know that the case for donating to improve US climate policy right now is strong \u2014 both because Biden\u2019s victory creates new openings and because the US is the biggest carbon polluter in history and the second-biggest carbon emitter in the world today. And while you may think that American climate work is already well-funded, there are pockets within it that are still neglected; for example, when it comes to lobbying to influence climate legislation, the fossil fuel industry has outspent environmental advocates 10 to 1 in recent years.  That said, if you\u2019re interested in donating to effective climate charities elsewhere in the world, check out this list, which includes high-impact groups that focus on other facets of the problem, such as protecting rainforests and tech innovation. Finally, if you like the groups that Founders Pledge recommends, note that donations that come through its Climate Fund are currently being matched by Erik Bergman, a marketing entrepreneur, until December 31.
