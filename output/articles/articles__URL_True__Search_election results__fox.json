    "article_text": "Kemp, Trump clash over election results Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, pushed back on President Trump\u2019s demands for\u00a0\u201csignature verification\u201d in an attempt to overturn election\u00a0results, saying he has called for such an audit three times. After Kemp and the president reportedly spoke Saturday morning, the Georgia governor reminded\u00a0Trump of their conversation. Trump took to Twitter to voice his frustration over losing the traditionally red state by 12,500 votes and said, \u201cI will easily & quickly win Georgia if Governor [Kemp] or the Secretary of State permit a simple signature verification.\u201d \u201cHas not been done and will show large scale discrepancies,\u201d Trump claimed. \u201cWhy are these two \u2018Republicans\u2019 saying no? If we win Georgia, everything else falls in place!\u201d But the president\u2019s Saturday comments did not line up with what Kemp reportedly told Trump. \u201cAs I told the President this morning, I\u2019ve publicly called for a signature audit three times (11/20, 11/24, 12/3) to restore confidence in our election process and to ensure that only legal votes are counted in Georgia,\u201d Kemp fired back on Twitter, directly responding to Trump\u2019s tweet. Trump later responded asking that the governor call for a \"special session of the legislature,\" calling the governing body together outside of the normal session periods. \"But you never got the signature verification! Your people are refusing to do what you ask,\" Trump replied on twitter.\u00a0\"What are they hiding? At least immediately ask for a Special Session of the Legislature. That you can easily, and immediately, do.\" Georgia officials\u00a0completed a hand recount of the votes along with an additional machine-based recount, both of which found\u00a0President-elect Joe Biden had won Georgia. But even if Trump did win Georgia, it would not be enough for reelection. Biden\u00a0already secured 279 Electoral College votes after California certified its results Friday. There still are three other\u00a0states -- Colorado, Hawaii and New Jersey \u2013 that Biden won but that have not yet certified votes. NEVADA GOP VOWS APPEAL AFTER JUDGE DISMISSES TRUMP CAMPAIGN\u2019S LATEST SUIT Biden is expected to be elected with 306 Electoral College votes to Trump\u2019s 232 votes. Friday, the Trump campaign filed another lawsuit in Georgia requesting the state courts\u00a0\u201corder a new election to be conducted in the presidential race,\u201d alleging \u201ctens of thousands of illegal votes.\u201d The Trump campaign\u2019s legal team has\u00a0issued dozens of lawsuits in several states claiming voter and election fraud \u2013 none of which have held up. \u201cWhat was filed today clearly documents that there are literally tens of thousands of illegal votes that were cast, counted, and included in the tabulations the Secretary of State is preparing to certify,\u201d Ray S. Smith III, attorney for the Trump campaign, said in the statement Friday.\u00a0\u201cThe Secretary of State has orchestrated the worst excuse for an election in Georgia history.\u201d \u201cWe are asking the Court to vacate the certification of the presidential election and to order a new statewide election for president,\u201d Smith added. Kemp is not the only Republican pushing back on Trump\u2019s repeated claims of fraud. Numerous investigations\u00a0have found no evidence of widespread fraud. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, dismissed\u00a0accusations of election fraud due to lack of evidence, and condemned Trump\u2019s \u201cviolent rhetoric.\u201d \u201cEven after this office's request that President Trump try and quell the violent rhetoric being born out of his continuing claims of winning the states where he obviously lost, he tweeted out \u2018expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia,\u2019\u201d Raffensperger said earlier this week during a press conference, reported Reuters.

    "article_text": "Georgia county recertifies election results, rejecting fraud claims tied to viral video One\u00a0Georgia\u00a0county recertified its election results on Friday as Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office debunked a recently surfaced video that appeared to show illegal ballot-counting without supervisors. The Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections adjourned a meeting Friday in which members voted to recertify the results of the 2020 presidential race in favor of President-elect Joe Biden in a 3-2 voice vote. Much of the meeting focused on a video that went viral Thursday, which political commentators claimed showed Fulton County election officials illegally stuffing ballots -- a form of election fraud in which more ballots are counted than were cast by eligible voters in a specific location. A senior source in Raffensperger's office\u00a0told\u00a0Fox\u00a0News that the video has\u00a0been investigated and claims that it showed ballot fraud deemed unfounded, adding that Fulton County election officials had a designated observer at the location the entire time -- a practice that has been in place since June. Raffensperger's office\u00a0also debunked allegations that the ballots were stuffed in\u00a0a pair of \"suitcases\" that one election official pulled out from beneath a table in the video, saying footage shows the ballots in the cases that they were supposed to be kept in.\u00a0 HANNITY ON SUSPICIOUS SUITCASE VIDEO Republican Georgia Rep. Jody Hice, however, shared the video on Twitter, calling the footage \"explosive fraud.\" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said during a Thursday interview on \"The Ingraham Angle\"\u00a0that\u00a0he has called for a signature audit into the video, but only the secretary of state has the power to order one. COLLINS IMPLORES GOP VOTERS TO TURN OUT FOR GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS: 'PEOPLE CANNOT GIVE UP ON THE SYSTEM' Georgia\u00a0election chief Gabe Sterling shared a fact-check article from a news outlet called Lead Stories in a Thursday tweet, saying, \"The 90-second video of election workers at State Farm arena, purporting to show fraud was watched in its entirety (hours) by\u00a0@GaSecofState investigators. Shows normal ballot processing. Here is the fact check on it.\" Fulton County Elections Director Richard Barron told the Board of Registration and Elections during Friday's hearing that he had not seen the video, but his staff told him the footage showed \"normal\" activity. Barron took questions from\u00a0Republican board members Kathleen Ruth and\u00a0Mark Wingate, who voted against certifying election results. In response to claims that staff and media left the counting site early, Barron said no one was told to leave early and that certain staff left after their duties concluded. Democratic board member Aaron Johnson said\u00a0the board needs to\u00a0\"sit down, look at what actually happened\" and do what they can to\u00a0\"find out what happened.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The deadline for all counties to complete their recounts was midnight Wednesday. Raffensperger\u00a0told \u201cYour World with Neil Cavuto\u201d in November that he expected\u00a0to see \"very similar\" results. \u201cWhen we did the first audit, we found mistakes in three counties and that added over 1,000 votes for President Trump,\" Raffensperger said.\u00a0\"That has all been accounted for, and so I think this one will be very close to what we just have now. I don\u2019t see much difference whatsoever.\u201d President Trump has criticized Raffensperger\u2019s oversight of the election, while Georgia Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both up for reelection in the January runoffs, have called for his resignation.",

    "article_text": "Alabama Rep-elect Barry Moore pledges to join challenge to electoral votes 'day one,' backs federal voter ID WASHINGTON \u2013 When Congressman-elect\u00a0Barry Moore enters Congress early next year, he plans immediately to join the fight to keep President Trump in office, challenging Electoral College votes with Rep. Mo Brooks, a fellow Alabama Republican. Moore, a former state legislator who staked a claim as the first elected official in the U.S. to endorse Trump in 2015, has been very active on social media in supporting the president's legal challenges to the election results and refusal to concede. And, in an interview with Fox News this week, he emphasized a desire to address \"election integrity\" in Congress \"regardless of who wins the election.\" \"We got to get it right. We got to make sure that either 70 or 80 million people don't feel disenfranchised and feel like it was stolen, regardless of which direction it goes,\" Moore said. \"You don't need to have somebody over here voting that's not necessarily legal or even it's not, they don't even exist. They just duplicate ballots and cancel you out or cancel me out.\" TRUMP THANKS\u00a0ALABAMA CONGRESSMAN WHO SAYS HE WILL CHALLENGE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES Moore added: \"We're governed by the consent of the people... and their consent is their vote and they consent to give us power. What if that power is not transferred ethically? Then it's an illegitimate election.\" Soon after the interview, Moore announced on social media he would support the Brooks challenge to the electoral votes. His office confirmed his intent. \"It\u2019s my honor to stand with @RepMoBrooks we met in his office yesterday it\u2019s time to stand it\u2019s time we draw a line I. The sand and advance #ElectionIntegrity ...it\u2019s the new #woke,\" Moore tweeted\u00a0Thursday.\u00a0He added that he would take up the election fight \"day one.\" Brooks, in an interview with \"Fox Across America,\" said he believed that state election laws on mail ballots were unconstitutional and that Congress should not be recognizing those votes.\u00a0 \"I, as a member of Congress and one of the judges and jurors that have the final and ultimate decision on who won this presidential election,\u00a0I'm not counting those ballots when I make a judgment as to whether a state submission of Electoral College votes is correct or incorrect,\" Brooks said.\u00a0\"I'm not counting any illegal ballots when I make that decision, and as such, in my judgment, if we limited our vote count to lawful votes cast by eligible American citizens, that\u00a0Donald Trump easily won a majority of the Electoral College and won reelection.\" TRUMP HINTS AT 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN WHITE HOUSE COMMENTS Moore is not the only incoming member to support Brooks. The highly controversial Congresswoman-elect Marjorie Taylor-Greene, R-Ga., has also said that she will support Brooks in challenging the Electoral College votes.\u00a0 The claim that the implementation of mail-in voting by states is unconstitutional has been\u00a0highly disputed.\u00a0In order to challenge an individual state\u2019s slate of electoral votes, a House and Senate member must both ask the bodies to debate and vote to accept or reject a state\u2019s electors. A state\u2019s electoral slate is tossed if both\u00a0the House and Senate then vote to reject it. That scenario is unlikely. Further,\u00a0allegations of\u00a0systemic voter fraud by the president and some of his allies have been largely unsubstantiated. Some lawsuits have challenged far fewer votes than the tens of thousands that Biden won by in key states. Others have included typos, factual errors or and more defects.\u00a0 Sweeping allegations of vote-switching by the voting software company Dominion, which some states used, also have not\u00a0been borne out, and judges routinely have ruled against suits brought by the Trump campaign and its allies. Attorney General Bill Barr said this week that his Justice Department\u00a0has not seen fraud on the kind of scale that could flip the election.\u00a0 FLORIDA REP.-ELECT KAT CAMMACK SHARES PERSONAL STORY ABOUT ABORTION: 'MY MOM CHOSE LIFE' \"To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,\" Barr told The Associated Press.\u00a0 Moore, though, said he would like Congress to address election security with federal legislation to ensure confidence and more uniformity. \"We passed the voter I.D. bill in Alabama, so when you go to vote, you show your I.D. and it's one person, one vote,\" Moore said. \"If another state\u00a0allows their constituents to cheat, then in many ways, these states that are doing it right are getting penalized for doing it right.\" He continued: \"There has to be a system, I think a national voter I.D., and I would be willing to fund the I.D. The federal government could put the funds, the money we spend in some areas... the American people have got to believe in the government that they've elected was duly elected by them.\" Moore mentioned that the federal government provides Americans with Social Security cards, and said a federal voter I.D. did not necessarily need to be a photo I.D., \"just the name lining up with the Social Security number when they vote.\" Moore added that he planned to speak with Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill to talk about how Alabama's elections were \"so smooth\" and how what can be learned from that state and apply on a national level.\u00a0 He also said he hoped to see\u00a0Barr investigate voter fraud claims more aggressively.\u00a0 REP.-ELECT CARLOS GIMENEZ, FORMER MIAMI DATE MAYOR, CONDEMNS OTHER MAYORS THAT 'ALLOWED MOB RULE' \"Barr says there's no evidence. How much time did you spend investigating?\" Moore said. \"I don't know. I don't want to be critical\u00a0of him because I think he's done a decent job in the past... How thorough of an investigation can you do in three weeks if it takes four years on collusion or two years on Ukraine or impeachment or whatever?\" The incoming congressman also said he considered himself a populist, which he defined as \"a movement in this nation which really wants the government to answer to its people... When [Trump] started bringing union people to support him and minority communities ... it said he cared about those people.\" Moore added: \"As a Republican, we need to help everybody... We can equal the starting line. We can't guarantee the outcome. People obviously have to make their own way in life.\" Moore, from a farming family,\u00a0represents a largely rural part of southeastern Alabama. His family has been farming peanuts and cotton. Moore himself started a garbage business, which, now a\u00a0member of Congress, he viewed\u00a0with pride and as evidence that the American Dream remained\u00a0possible. \"The one thing I tell my kids and I tell a lot of people is that the greatest thing in this nation we can give to the next generation is the freedom to excel in however they're created to do,\" Moore said. \"I started my garbage company driving the garbage truck, I started my company the ground up. I was the mechanic. I was the garbage truck driver, and I sit here before you today as a garbage man... in Congress and it's because those freedoms and the opportunities were afforded to me.\" He added: \"I don't know now that my son could do it. There's too many regulations. The government would shut him down... Capitalism is a great system. It's not perfect, but it's the best system man has come up with to lift anybody out of poverty.\" Moore's 2nd Congressional District includes Maxwell Air Force Base and Fort Rucker, one of the handful\u00a0of U.S. military installations named after Confederate generals. Trump has threatened to veto the National Defense Authorization Act bill currently being considered in both chambers if it included a provision renaming military posts\u00a0named after Confederates.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I wouldn't support renaming any of these bases,\" Moore said in a GOP primary debate broadcast by WTVY.\u00a0\"The legacy that is there, the people that left and they went off and fought wars -- foreign lands they fought wars -- we defeated a lot of the War on Terror from their bases. My son-in-law who just deployed to Iraq from Fort Bragg, his grandaddy went through Fort Bragg. That's a legacy that I wouldn't want to rob any family of.\" Moore, a veteran with an agricultural sciences degree, said two committees he would most like to join are the Agriculture Committee and the Armed Services Committee. The latter is set to see a new ranking member in Rep. Mike Rogers, a fellow Alabama Republican. Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.\u00a0",

    "article_text": "Barr: DOJ yet to find widespread voter fraud that could have changed 2020 election Attorney General William Barr said Tuesday that the Justice Department has not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, despite claims by President Trump and his campaign\u2019s legal team. Barr, during an interview with The Associated Press\u00a0Tuesday, said that U.S. attorneys and FBI officials have been working to follow up on specific complaints and information they have received, but have not uncovered enough\u00a0evidence that would change the outcome of the election. TRUMP CAMPAIGN FILES LAWSUIT IN WISCONSIN, ALLEGES 'ABUSE' OF ABSENTEE VOTING SYSTEM \u201cTo date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,\" Barr told The Associated Press. The DOJ on Tuesday attempted to clear up Barr's statement, with a spokesperson saying that a number of media outlets have \"incorrectly reported that the Department has concluded its investigation of election fraud.\" \u201cSome media outlets have incorrectly reported that the Department has concluded its investigation of election fraud and announced an affirmative finding of no fraud in the election,\" the spokesperson said.\u00a0\"That is not what the Associated Press reported nor what the Attorney General stated. The Department will continue to receive and vigorously pursue all specific and credible allegations of fraud as expeditiously as possible.\u201d Last month, Barr issued a directive to U.S. attorneys across the country allowing them to pursue any \u201csubstantial allegations\u201d of voting irregularities if they existed, before the results of the 2020 presidential race were certified. Barr\u2019s move gave prosecutors the ability to go around Justice Department policy that typically would prohibit investigations of the time before the election was certified. Soon after Barr\u2019s memo was issued, the Justice Department\u2019s top elections crime official announced he would step aside from that position. Barr'\u00a0interview comes two days after Trump told Fox News that the DOJ has been \"missing in action\" on possible election fraud.\u00a0Trump told \"Sunday Morning Futures\" Sunday that he has \u201cnot seen anything\u201d from the DOJ or FBI\u00a0on investigating the\u00a02020 election. \u201cYou would think if you\u2019re in the\u00a0FBI or Department of\u00a0Justice, this is the biggest\u00a0thing you could be looking at,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0\u201cWhere are they?\u00a0I\u2019ve not seen anything.\u201d \u201cThey just keep moving\u00a0along and they go on to the next\u00a0president,\u201d he continued. TRUMP: DOJ 'MISSING IN ACTION' ON ALLEGED ELECTION FRAUD The Trump campaign has filed lawsuits in a number of key battleground states where President-elect Joe Biden led by a razor-thin margin. The Trump campaign has been alleging a widespread conspiracy to dump millions of illegal votes into the system, but has not provided substantial evidence to support those claims. The campaign\u2019s legal effort, led by Rudy Giuliani, has, in large part, been focused on Republican poll watchers being blocked from viewing vote counting at polling sites in some locations. Those claims have been dismissed by even Republican-appointed judges, who have said the cases lack evidence. Election officials in many of those states, though, have certified Biden\u2019s victory. Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, who also is leading the campaign's legal effort,\u00a0on Tuesday, fired back at Barr.\u00a0 \u201cWith all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn\u2019t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation,\" Giuliani and Ellis\u00a0said in a statement. \"We have gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined. We have many witnesses swearing under oath they saw crimes being committed in connection with voter fraud.\" They\u00a0added: \"As far as we know, not a single one has been interviewed by the DOJ. The Justice Department also hasn\u2019t audited any voting machines or used their subpoena powers to determine the truth.\"\u00a0 They\u00a0said that the campaign will \"continue our pursuit of the truth through the judicial system and state legislatures, and continue toward the Constitution\u2019s mandate and ensuring that every legal vote is counted and every illegal vote is not.\" \"Again, with the greatest respect to the Attorney General, his opinion appears to be without any knowledge or investigation of the substantial irregularities and evidence of systemic fraud,\" they said.\u00a0 Trump\u00a0has not yet conceded to Biden, despite allowing the formal transition process to begin, and continues to blast election officials in multiple states, while also claiming the 2020 presidential election was rigged. The Trump administration has said, though, that the 2020 election was the most secure ever. ARIZONA, WISCONSIN CERTIFY BIDEN AS ELECTION WINNER \"There's been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results,\u201d Barr told the AP. \u201cAnd the DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven't seen anything to substantiate that.\u201d Barr added that people have been confusing the use of the federal criminal justice system with allegations that should be made in civil lawsuits, adding that such a remedy for those complaints would be a top-down audit conducted by state or local officials, not the U.S. Justice Department. \"There's a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fix-all, and people don't like something they want the Department of Justice to come in and 'investigate,\"' Barr said, adding that there must be a basis to believe there is a crime to investigate. \"Most claims of fraud are very particularized to a particular set of circumstances or actors or conduct. They are not systemic allegations and. And those have been run down; they are being run down,\" Barr said. \"Some have been broad and potentially cover a few thousand votes. They have been followed up on.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News' Talia Kaplan and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
