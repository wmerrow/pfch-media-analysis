    "article_text": "9 questions about the Georgia Senate runoffs you were too embarrassed to ask  Georgia voters will determine which party controls the US Senate on January 5, and thus decide the fate of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. There are not one but two runoff Senate elections in Georgia early next year. They have similar dynamics, with Democratic challengers going up against Republican incumbents. One race features a matchup between Sen. David Perdue (R) and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other involves Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters who requested them starting on November 18, while in-person early voting starts on December 14 and continues until Election Day on January 5. At first glance, Democrats appear to be the underdogs. Georgia is historically Republican, and Democrats haven\u2019t had a good track record in past Senate runoffs, losing the most recent one in 2008. At the same time, Democrats insist several things are different this year: Their party\u2019s presidential nominee won the state for the first time in almost 30 years, they have two candidates, and the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance. Enthusiasm against President Trump ultimately aided Biden in the presidential election, and Democrats are clearly hoping for a repeat on that front. But the big unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s continued refusal to concede will play into all of this. \u201cTrump is not on the ballot, but are we in a post-Trump era where our people are motivated to show up?\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cThat is the big question.\u201d Georgia\u2019s runoff system is unusual in American politics, and the dynamics this year are also unusual. The results of these races will potentially have an outsize influence on the next four years.  We\u2019ve broken down the essential questions here.   There\u2019s a huge amount at stake for both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia. The state will decide which party controls the US Senate \u2014 and, by extension, whether there will be divided or unified government in Washington, DC. \u201cDemocrats are going to be very excited in Georgia but also nationally,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock recently told Vox. \u201cOssoff and Warnock, any kind of resource or help they need, they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Republicans are equally energized to keep the Senate in GOP hands so they can have a definitive say in the agenda of President-elect Biden. The ambitiousness of Biden\u2019s agenda as president hangs in the balance, as does his ability to select Cabinet members and judicial nominees \u2014 all of whom are confirmed by the Senate. The only problem: Many Republicans cannot publicly admit that Biden has officially won without angering Trump. Being hamstrung hampers their argument on this front.  \u201cWe\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be standing out here alone,\u201d Perdue said on a recent private donor call obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can\u2019t wait for that.\u201d To be clear, winning both seats won\u2019t give Democrats license to pass a raft of leftist legislation. Democrats\u2019 best-case scenario right now is a 50-50 split Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote for a simple majority.  But Democrats still have a number of conservative members in their caucus like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), who will likely temper their ambition and prioritize bipartisan cooperation with Republicans. They\u2019ll also likely have to deal with the Senate filibuster, needing 60 votes to pass major bills.  Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s Georgia rally was supposed to pump up Loeffler and Perdue. It ended up being a grievance-fest. Outgoing President Donald Trump traveled to Valdosta, Georgia, on Saturday for a rally that was ostensibly meant to pump up voters and encourage them to support Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue ahead of next month\u2019s runoff elections. But, perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump ended up having a hard time talking about anything but himself and his grievances. Trump\u2019s trip to Georgia for his first post-election rally came as he continues to push lies about the election being stolen from him \u2014 and as he makes a last-ditch push for Republican-controlled legislatures to overturn the election results. Much of Trump\u2019s remarks consisted of variations on these themes, and his insistence that the election was rigged against him in states he lost, like Georgia, was at tension with the idea it\u2019s important for Republicans to turn out for Loeffler and Perdue.  That incoherency was evident throughout Trump\u2019s speech on Saturday, which began with him brazenly lying that he actually won Georgia. \u201cWe won Georgia, just so you understand,\u201d Trump said, even though his loss in the state has already been certified by Georgia election officials. Trump ended up repeating this lie so many times throughout his speech that by the end of it he was mentioning it in passing as if it\u2019s settled fact. Despite his insistence that the Georgia Republicans who run the state at best looked the other way while Democrats conspired to steal the election from him, Trump at other points urged his fans to go out and vote for Loeffler and Perdue, saying things like, \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote, the socialists and communists win.\u201d  But what the president didn\u2019t bother trying to explain is why Republican voters should have any confidence the runoffs won\u2019t be rigged just like he says the presidential election was, given that they will be run by the same officials. Both Georgia senators are in tight races, and the slim margin by which Trump lost the state would make it seem that even a slightly depressed turnout could cost Loeffler and Perdue their seats come January. And should they both lose, Democrats will regain control of the Senate thanks to the tiebreaking vote of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Republicans were counting on the president to help provide both candidates with some momentum. But the downside of Trump\u2019s difficulty talking about anything other than himself or the alleged terribleness of other people became evident when Loeffler and Perdue took the stage to tepid applause. Their brief remarks were truncated by \u201cfight for Trump!\u201d chants that drowned them out. The Georgia rally came hours after Trump reportedly phoned Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, and asked him to convene a special session of the legislature to overturn the election results. Kemp reportedly turned Trump down, and perhaps as a result, Trump attacked him a number of times throughout his speech, at one point telling his fans, \u201cYour governor should be ashamed of himself.\u201d Then, toward the end of the rally, Trump outlined the desperate two-front battle he\u2019s trying to fight to overturn the election, saying, \u201chopefully our legislatures and the United States Supreme Court will step forward and save our country.\u201d But since neither Republican-controlled state legislatures or the Supreme Court have thus far shown much inclination to get involved in an election President-elect Joe Biden clearly won, Trump appears to have a backup plan \u2014 one he expressed in a fittingly incoherent manner. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win back the White House. We\u2019re gonna win it back,\u201d Trump said, teasing a 2024 run, but he then immediately added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait until 2024. I want to go back three weeks.\u201d Unfortunately for Trump, there\u2019s no do-overs. But in the meantime, his refusal to concede has led to a fundraising bonanza that could end up helping him launch a bid to avenge his loss to Biden, based on the \u201cthey stole it from me\u201d lies he\u2019s been pushing over the month since Election Day.",

That\u2019s despite two recounts in the state \u2014 overseen by Republican officials \u2014 both indicating Biden\u2019s victory in the state is unambiguous and not going to change. Trump\u2019s new lawsuit, filed in a Georgia state court on Friday, represents the latest of dozens of efforts by his campaign and its allies to contest the legitimacy of vote counts in key states across the nation, all of which have failed to gain traction \u2014 or even be taken seriously by judges \u2014 with the exception of one minor win involving an insignificant number of ballots. But while Trump\u2019s quixotic legal efforts and evidence-free claims of voter fraud have no chance at overturning the results of the presidential election, according to legal experts, they continue to shape Republicans\u2019 widespread reluctance to acknowledge the legitimacy of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s incoming administration, potentially setting the stage for even higher levels of polarization in Washington than before.       According to ABC News, Trump\u2019s latest Georgia lawsuit alleges that the state\u2019s election code was \u201cdisregarded, abandoned, ignored, altered, and otherwise violated,\u201d resulting in \u201ca sufficient number of illegal votes\u201d being included in the count. The lawsuit takes issue with rule changes regarding the eligibility of ballots, and includes allegations of fraud \u201cbased on witness affidavits, but with little evidence,\u201d ABC\u2019s Olivia Rubin and Matthew Mosk report. Trump\u2019s team is using these claims to call for \u201ca new Presidential Election to occur at the earliest opportune time.\u201d Georgia is in the midst of its third tally of votes overseen by Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, and Biden\u2019s margin of victory, while narrow, appears firm. Georgia\u2019s unprecedented hand-count audit confirmed Biden\u2019s victory over Trump, modestly reducing his margin of victory from 13,558 votes to 12,284 votes. And on Friday, preliminary results of a machine recount of the votes indicated that Biden is on track for a similar margin of victory on the third count of the ballots. The day that Trump\u2019s team filed the Georgia lawsuit, they also suffered two more legal defeats. In Nevada, a district judge denied a lawsuit from the Trump campaign contesting the state\u2019s results based on allegations of malfeasance. The judge said the legal team \u201cfailed to meet their burden to provide credible and relevant evidence.\u201d And the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to hear Trump\u2019s lawsuit attempting to overturn his loss. Trump and his allies have filed at least 46 lawsuits across the country and their efforts have gone poorly, with even conservative and Trump-appointed judges writing scathing rejections of lawsuits bereft of credible evidence of election official misconduct, incompetence, or fraud. Earlier this week, Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop summarized the state of Trump\u2019s \u201cstop the steal\u201d politicking: \u201cThe lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors.\u201d Trump has called on those state legislative leaders to aid him in stealing the election by appointing electors to the Electoral College who are willing to ignore the results of the election in their states and cast their votes for him rather than for Biden.  As Prokop has explained, this scheme would be difficult to pull off in states in which the GOP isn\u2019t in control of the legislature, courts, and governorship \u2014 and is also one that has been routinely rejected by Republican lawmakers in swing states like Michigan. Only in Pennsylvania have GOP lawmakers endorsed such a plan, and there, their plans appear set to be foiled by the state\u2019s Democratic House and governor. This leaves lawsuits as the president\u2019s only remaining avenue for overturning the election\u2019s results. But these lawsuits have become so transparently filed in bad faith that state and local officials are beginning to call for judges to sanction Trump campaign and Republican lawyers.  Legal experts aren\u2019t ruling out the possibility that judges could use financial penalties to deter future lawsuits, since Trump\u2019s legal efforts in many states have involve repeatedly bringing recycled, discredited claims and affidavits to court, a practice that could be deemed abusive. \u201cYou could see a court saying, \u2018Enough is enough,\u2019\u201d Daniel Weiner, deputy director of New York University\u2019s Brennan Center election reform program, told ABC News. Despite Biden\u2019s decisive victory in the Electoral College, and the dozens of lawsuits failing to gain any traction, the majority of Republican lawmakers in Washington have declined to question their legitimacy or acknowledge Biden\u2019s status as incoming president.  This week, the Washington Post surveyed every Republican in Congress, and found that fewer than 30 were willing to acknowledge Biden\u2019s victory over Trump. Meanwhile more than 200 Republican members of the House and Senate would \u201csimply not say who won the election.\u201d Trump responded to the results of the Post\u2019s survey with anger, and suggested he wanted to retaliate against the small minority of Republicans who acknowledged he lost the election. \u201cI am surprised there are so many,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday. \u201cWe have just begun to fight. Please send me a list of the 25 RINOS.\u201d RINO is an acronym which stands for \u201cRepublican in name only,\u201d typically used on the right to criticize a Republican for being insufficiently conservative. Trump\u2019s extended legal battles, combined with his weeks-long insistence on Twitter and other platforms that the election was rigged, have also had a strong effect on public opinion.  For example, a mid-November Economist/YouGov poll found that 89 percent of Trump voters believe that voter fraud affected the election outcome, and a majority think it changed the outcome.  While Trump\u2019s legal fights have surfaced no evidence of widespread fraud or misconduct, they have successfully lent credibility to his campaign to convince large swaths of the public that the election was stolen. And that might be their most important legacy.         ",

    "article_text": "9 questions about the Georgia Senate runoffs you were too embarrassed to ask  Georgia voters will determine which party controls the US Senate on January 5, and thus decide the fate of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. There are not one but two runoff Senate elections in Georgia early next year. They have similar dynamics, with Democratic challengers going up against Republican incumbents. One race features a matchup between Sen. David Perdue (R) and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other involves Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters who requested them starting on November 18, while in-person early voting starts on December 14 and continues until Election Day on January 5. At first glance, Democrats appear to be the underdogs. Georgia is historically Republican, and Democrats haven\u2019t had a good track record in past Senate runoffs, losing the most recent one in 2008. At the same time, Democrats insist several things are different this year: Their party\u2019s presidential nominee won the state for the first time in almost 30 years, they have two candidates, and the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance. Enthusiasm against President Trump ultimately aided Biden in the presidential election, and Democrats are clearly hoping for a repeat on that front. But the big unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s continued refusal to concede will play into all of this. \u201cTrump is not on the ballot, but are we in a post-Trump era where our people are motivated to show up?\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cThat is the big question.\u201d Georgia\u2019s runoff system is unusual in American politics, and the dynamics this year are also unusual. The results of these races will potentially have an outsize influence on the next four years.  We\u2019ve broken down the essential questions here.   There\u2019s a huge amount at stake for both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia. The state will decide which party controls the US Senate \u2014 and, by extension, whether there will be divided or unified government in Washington, DC. \u201cDemocrats are going to be very excited in Georgia but also nationally,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock recently told Vox. \u201cOssoff and Warnock, any kind of resource or help they need, they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Republicans are equally energized to keep the Senate in GOP hands so they can have a definitive say in the agenda of President-elect Biden. The ambitiousness of Biden\u2019s agenda as president hangs in the balance, as does his ability to select Cabinet members and judicial nominees \u2014 all of whom are confirmed by the Senate. The only problem: Many Republicans cannot publicly admit that Biden has officially won without angering Trump. Being hamstrung hampers their argument on this front.  \u201cWe\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be standing out here alone,\u201d Perdue said on a recent private donor call obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can\u2019t wait for that.\u201d To be clear, winning both seats won\u2019t give Democrats license to pass a raft of leftist legislation. Democrats\u2019 best-case scenario right now is a 50-50 split Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote for a simple majority.  But Democrats still have a number of conservative members in their caucus like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), who will likely temper their ambition and prioritize bipartisan cooperation with Republicans. They\u2019ll also likely have to deal with the Senate filibuster, needing 60 votes to pass major bills.  Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",

That said, pollsters in Georgia did a pretty good job with the presidential and Senate races. The FiveThirtyEight polling average predicted that Biden would win the state by 1.2 points. He wound up winning by 0.2 points. So the polls were only off by 1 percentage point, and close in the initial Senate races, too. That suggests that Georgia polling is more reliable than the polls in many other states. Which brings us to a new SurveyUSA poll looking at the January 5 runoff elections in Georgia, which will decide which party controls the United States Senate (SurveyUSA is an \u201cA\u201d rated pollster, according to FiveThirtyEight). The topline in this poll is that Democrat Raphael Warnock leads appointed Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler by a 52-45 margin. Meanwhile, Democrat Jon Ossoff leads incumbent Republican Sen. David Purdue by a smaller 50-48 margin.  This poll is just one snapshot of the race. But if Democrats do win both seats, the incoming Senate would be evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, which means that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would hold the tie-breaking vote and Sen. Chuck Schumer would be majority leader (though Republicans would likely still be able to filibuster most legislation). One interesting thing about the SurveyUSA poll is that it offers a window into whether Republican turnout is likely to drop because of efforts by President Trump and his allies to diminish confidence in US elections. Briefly, the poll suggests that a small but significant number of Georgia Republicans do plan to sit out the election due to those efforts \u2014 enough to potentially flip these races to Warnock and Ossoff. Even before many outlets had called the 2020 race for Biden, Trump and his allies started touting evidence-free claims that Trump only lost because of widespread voter fraud. Trump campaign lawyers and lawyers aligned with the campaign also filed a series of meritless lawsuits challenging the election results or seeking to prevent states from certifying Biden\u2019s victory. These lawsuits have accomplished little, if anything. Trump has also attacked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp, both of whom are Republicans, for supposedly enabling voter fraud in that state. Again, there is no evidence that such fraud exists. Some of Trump\u2019s allies have even gone so far as to urge Republicans to boycott the Georgia runoff elections. At a rally in Atlanta this week, for example, former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell said that she \u201cwould encourage all Georgians to make it known that you will not vote at all until your vote is secure.\u201d These attempts to undermine confidence in the Georgia runoff elections appear to be having an effect. The SurveyUSA poll interviewed a total of 717 registered voters, 118 of whom said they are not likely to vote in the runoff. Of these likely non-voters, 13 percent said they planned not to vote because \u201cthe voting process is rigged.\u201d Another 5 percent said they are \u201cintentionally boycotting the runoff.\u201d To be clear, 118 respondents is a very small sample size, so no one should take these figures as gospel. But there\u2019s other evidence that Republicans are more likely to sit out the January 5 runoffs than Democrats. As data journalist Nate Silver notes, the poll suggests that the January electorate could be 3 to 4 points more Democratic than the voters who turned out in November. In other words, if Warnock and Ossoff do prevail next month, they could have Trump and Trump allies like Sidney Powell to thank for their victory. Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine confidence in the election are likely to be ignored by Democrats, but they appear to be resonating with at least some Republicans.  And in two close elections, if even a small fraction of Republicans decide that their votes won\u2019t matter, that could swing both races to Democrats.",

    "article_text": "9 questions about the Georgia Senate runoffs you were too embarrassed to ask  Georgia voters will determine which party controls the US Senate on January 5, and thus decide the fate of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. There are not one but two runoff Senate elections in Georgia early next year. They have similar dynamics, with Democratic challengers going up against Republican incumbents. One race features a matchup between Sen. David Perdue (R) and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other involves Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters who requested them starting on November 18, while in-person early voting starts on December 14 and continues until Election Day on January 5. At first glance, Democrats appear to be the underdogs. Georgia is historically Republican, and Democrats haven\u2019t had a good track record in past Senate runoffs, losing the most recent one in 2008. At the same time, Democrats insist several things are different this year: Their party\u2019s presidential nominee won the state for the first time in almost 30 years, they have two candidates, and the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance. Enthusiasm against President Trump ultimately aided Biden in the presidential election, and Democrats are clearly hoping for a repeat on that front. But the big unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s continued refusal to concede will play into all of this. \u201cTrump is not on the ballot, but are we in a post-Trump era where our people are motivated to show up?\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cThat is the big question.\u201d Georgia\u2019s runoff system is unusual in American politics, and the dynamics this year are also unusual. The results of these races will potentially have an outsize influence on the next four years.  We\u2019ve broken down the essential questions here.   There\u2019s a huge amount at stake for both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia. The state will decide which party controls the US Senate \u2014 and, by extension, whether there will be divided or unified government in Washington, DC. \u201cDemocrats are going to be very excited in Georgia but also nationally,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock recently told Vox. \u201cOssoff and Warnock, any kind of resource or help they need, they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Republicans are equally energized to keep the Senate in GOP hands so they can have a definitive say in the agenda of President-elect Biden. The ambitiousness of Biden\u2019s agenda as president hangs in the balance, as does his ability to select Cabinet members and judicial nominees \u2014 all of whom are confirmed by the Senate. The only problem: Many Republicans cannot publicly admit that Biden has officially won without angering Trump. Being hamstrung hampers their argument on this front.  \u201cWe\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be standing out here alone,\u201d Perdue said on a recent private donor call obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can\u2019t wait for that.\u201d To be clear, winning both seats won\u2019t give Democrats license to pass a raft of leftist legislation. Democrats\u2019 best-case scenario right now is a 50-50 split Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote for a simple majority.  But Democrats still have a number of conservative members in their caucus like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), who will likely temper their ambition and prioritize bipartisan cooperation with Republicans. They\u2019ll also likely have to deal with the Senate filibuster, needing 60 votes to pass major bills.  Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",

    "article_text": "9 questions about the Georgia Senate runoffs you were too embarrassed to ask  Georgia voters will determine which party controls the US Senate on January 5, and thus decide the fate of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. There are not one but two runoff Senate elections in Georgia early next year. They have similar dynamics, with Democratic challengers going up against Republican incumbents. One race features a matchup between Sen. David Perdue (R) and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other involves Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters who requested them starting on November 18, while in-person early voting starts on December 14 and continues until Election Day on January 5. At first glance, Democrats appear to be the underdogs. Georgia is historically Republican, and Democrats haven\u2019t had a good track record in past Senate runoffs, losing the most recent one in 2008. At the same time, Democrats insist several things are different this year: Their party\u2019s presidential nominee won the state for the first time in almost 30 years, they have two candidates, and the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance. Enthusiasm against President Trump ultimately aided Biden in the presidential election, and Democrats are clearly hoping for a repeat on that front. But the big unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s continued refusal to concede will play into all of this. \u201cTrump is not on the ballot, but are we in a post-Trump era where our people are motivated to show up?\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cThat is the big question.\u201d Georgia\u2019s runoff system is unusual in American politics, and the dynamics this year are also unusual. The results of these races will potentially have an outsize influence on the next four years.  We\u2019ve broken down the essential questions here.   There\u2019s a huge amount at stake for both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia. The state will decide which party controls the US Senate \u2014 and, by extension, whether there will be divided or unified government in Washington, DC. \u201cDemocrats are going to be very excited in Georgia but also nationally,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock recently told Vox. \u201cOssoff and Warnock, any kind of resource or help they need, they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Republicans are equally energized to keep the Senate in GOP hands so they can have a definitive say in the agenda of President-elect Biden. The ambitiousness of Biden\u2019s agenda as president hangs in the balance, as does his ability to select Cabinet members and judicial nominees \u2014 all of whom are confirmed by the Senate. The only problem: Many Republicans cannot publicly admit that Biden has officially won without angering Trump. Being hamstrung hampers their argument on this front.  \u201cWe\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be standing out here alone,\u201d Perdue said on a recent private donor call obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can\u2019t wait for that.\u201d To be clear, winning both seats won\u2019t give Democrats license to pass a raft of leftist legislation. Democrats\u2019 best-case scenario right now is a 50-50 split Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote for a simple majority.  But Democrats still have a number of conservative members in their caucus like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), who will likely temper their ambition and prioritize bipartisan cooperation with Republicans. They\u2019ll also likely have to deal with the Senate filibuster, needing 60 votes to pass major bills.  Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",

It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",

    "article_text": "9 questions about the Georgia Senate runoffs you were too embarrassed to ask  Georgia voters will determine which party controls the US Senate on January 5, and thus decide the fate of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. There are not one but two runoff Senate elections in Georgia early next year. They have similar dynamics, with Democratic challengers going up against Republican incumbents. One race features a matchup between Sen. David Perdue (R) and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other involves Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters who requested them starting on November 18, while in-person early voting starts on December 14 and continues until Election Day on January 5. At first glance, Democrats appear to be the underdogs. Georgia is historically Republican, and Democrats haven\u2019t had a good track record in past Senate runoffs, losing the most recent one in 2008. At the same time, Democrats insist several things are different this year: Their party\u2019s presidential nominee won the state for the first time in almost 30 years, they have two candidates, and the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance. Enthusiasm against President Trump ultimately aided Biden in the presidential election, and Democrats are clearly hoping for a repeat on that front. But the big unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s continued refusal to concede will play into all of this. \u201cTrump is not on the ballot, but are we in a post-Trump era where our people are motivated to show up?\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cThat is the big question.\u201d Georgia\u2019s runoff system is unusual in American politics, and the dynamics this year are also unusual. The results of these races will potentially have an outsize influence on the next four years.  We\u2019ve broken down the essential questions here.   There\u2019s a huge amount at stake for both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia. The state will decide which party controls the US Senate \u2014 and, by extension, whether there will be divided or unified government in Washington, DC. \u201cDemocrats are going to be very excited in Georgia but also nationally,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock recently told Vox. \u201cOssoff and Warnock, any kind of resource or help they need, they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Republicans are equally energized to keep the Senate in GOP hands so they can have a definitive say in the agenda of President-elect Biden. The ambitiousness of Biden\u2019s agenda as president hangs in the balance, as does his ability to select Cabinet members and judicial nominees \u2014 all of whom are confirmed by the Senate. The only problem: Many Republicans cannot publicly admit that Biden has officially won without angering Trump. Being hamstrung hampers their argument on this front.  \u201cWe\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be standing out here alone,\u201d Perdue said on a recent private donor call obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can\u2019t wait for that.\u201d To be clear, winning both seats won\u2019t give Democrats license to pass a raft of leftist legislation. Democrats\u2019 best-case scenario right now is a 50-50 split Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote for a simple majority.  But Democrats still have a number of conservative members in their caucus like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), who will likely temper their ambition and prioritize bipartisan cooperation with Republicans. They\u2019ll also likely have to deal with the Senate filibuster, needing 60 votes to pass major bills.  Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas.

Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon.

While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",
