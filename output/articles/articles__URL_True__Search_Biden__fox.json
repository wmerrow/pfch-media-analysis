    "article_text": "Biden, Harris double down on controversial Cabinet pick Neera Tanden President-elect\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are doubling down on their controversial nominee for director of the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden. Tanden, a Hillary Clinton loyalist and CEO of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, has drawn ire from conservative Republicans\u00a0and progressive Democrats alike. Her confirmation may hang\u00a0on the outcome of Georgia's Senate runoff elections in January, which will determine which party gets control of the upper chamber. TULSI GABBARD URGES SENATE TO VOTE 'NO' ON THIS BIDEN CABINET PICK \"Like me, [Tanden] was raised by a single mother and knows firsthand the importance of having an economy that treats all people with dignity and respect,\"\u00a0Harris tweeted Friday.\u00a0\"I know with her at the helm of the Office of Management and Budget, our budget will fully reflect our values.\" Her tweet came in response to a video Tanden posted to Twitter in which she told how she was raised by a single mother, and how her family depended on welfare to succeed. BIDEN PICK OVERSAW FLOOD OF FOREIGN MONEY INTO LIBERAL THINK TANK \"Families all across our country are worried,\" Tanden wrote. \"Worried about paying bills, rent \u2013 too many of the most basic necessities have been placed out of reach. Our government must invest in people to put an end to this worry, and revive our economy.\" Biden also defended Tanden in an interview with New York Times columnist Thomas Freidman published Wednesday, suggesting that Republican criticism of his pick -- because of her \"trail of nasty tweets\" -- is hypocritical. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION PICK OUTED SEXUAL HARRASSMENT VICTIM AT LIBERAL THINK TANK: REPORT \"That disqualifies almost every Republican senator and 90 percent of the [Trump] administration,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut by the way, she\u2019s smart as hell. Yeah, I think they\u2019re going to pick a couple of people just to fight [over], no matter what.\u201d On the flip side, Tanden has not been so quick to defend the former vice president. A leaked email\u00a0from 2015 indicates that the OMB nominee may not have always believed Biden was the best\u00a0Democratic\u00a0presidential candidate for the job.\u00a0 In an email sent\u00a0to John Podesta, former chief of staff for Bill Clinton,\u00a0on Oct. 20, 2015, Tanden said\u00a0she had more confidence in Hillary Clinton, who was running for president at the time,\u00a0than Biden. \u201cThe good thing about a Biden run is that he would make Hillary look so much better,\u201d Tanden said.\u00a0 CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP If confirmed by the Senate, she\u00a0would be the first Indian-American and first woman of color to serve as director of the OMB.",

Zients will be tasked with overseeing the rollout of the vaccine and mobilizing economic aid, among other priorities.\u00a0 Under President Obama, Zients served as director of the National Economic Council and acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.\u00a0 Democratic consulting firm Saguaro Strategies scrubbed the page over the summer and fall as Zients\u2019 profile rose after he joined the Biden transition team. The firm made the changes using the name \u201cSaguarostrat,\u201d with the intent to clean up anything that could be politically damaging. A Saguaro Strategies staffer confirmed to Politico that the Wikipedia account was linked to the firm. After Politico reached out, the username was changed to Cactus78910. BIDEN URGES TAKING CORONAVIRUS VACCINE, WEARING MASKS BUT SAYS THEY SHOULDN'T BE MANDATORY One chief executive on former President Obama\u2019s jobs council remarked that he thought Zients, then a top Obama aide, was a Republican, his Wiki page used to read. The section has been deleted.\u00a0 Politico reports that one section -- where Zients spoke highly of the management consulting firm Bain -- was removed\u00a0but as of this writing it has returned. Zients reportedly \"fell in love with Bain's culture, teamwork \u2026 and analytical rigor,\u201d the section reads.\u00a0 TULSI GABBARD URGES SENATE TO VOTE 'NO' ON THIS CABINET PICK The firm also added that Zients left Facebook over \u00a0\u201cover differences with company leadership over governance and its policies around political discourse.\u201d\u00a0Zients has never said that publicly. At the top of the section about Zients\u2019 role advocating for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has seen left-wing opposition, the firm added Zients\u2019 argument that it was \u201cthe most progressive trade agreement there\u2019s ever been.\u201d\u00a0 As of this writing, that section has been removed. Zients\u2019 promotion of the TPP quotes him as saying: \u00a0\"[t]hink of TPP as tax cuts \u2026 it cuts tariffs and sweeps away barriers to trade.\u201d A sudden scrubbing of someone\u2019s Wikipedia page is not uncommon for individuals angling for a high-profile post. In June, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris\u2019 Wikipedia page was scrubbed more than any other vice presidential contender and the majority of edits were made by a single person, The Intercept reported.\u00a0 WestExec Advisors\u00a0removed mention of its China-related work from its website just before Biden became the nominee.\u00a0 Several of Biden\u2019s cabinet picks have worked for the firm, including its co-founder, Anthony Blinken, who is the nominee for secretary of state, and a former WestExec principal, Avril Haines, who is the nominee for director of national intelligence. Web archives\u00a0show that as recently as late July, the firm was touting its success in helping U.S. research universities accept donations from China, expand foreign research collaboration, and welcome foreign students in key STEM programs while remaining a \u201ctrusted partner for (Department of Defense) -sponsored research grants.\u201d In early August, the firm said it had helped a leading American pharmaceutical company and a multibillion-dollar American technology company gain market access to China. Both references were removed in early August",

    "article_text": "CNN's Tapper asks Biden about potential family biz conflicts after avoiding son Hunter during campaign CNN anchor Jake Tapper appears to have had a sudden change of heart about the seriousness of the potential impropriety of the\u00a0Biden family's business ties after previously dismissing the Hunter Biden controversy that emerged in the final weeks of the presidential election.\u00a0 During his interview on Thursday with President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris, Tapper mentioned how Harris' husband, incoming Second Gentlemen Doug Emhoff, was leaving his law firm to avoid any appearance of conflicts of interest ahead of the new administration and quickly pivoted to the president-elect's own potential concerns.\u00a0 JAKE TAPPER DECLARES HUNTER BIDEN CLAIMS 'TOO DISGUSTING' TO REPEAT ON CNN: 'THE RIGHTWING IS GOING CRAZY' \"When your son came under scrutiny during the campaign, you vowed 'No one in my family or associated with me will be involved in any foreign operations whatsoever. Period. End of story,'\" Tapper began the exchange. \"Will your brothers, will your son take leave from any business interests, not just foreign but any business interests, that might create any even an appearance of impropriety?\" \"My son, my family will not be involved in any business, any enterprise that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict with an appropriate distance from the\u00a0presidency and government,\" Biden responded.\u00a0 Tapper quickly moved on to another topic without any follow-up questions.\u00a0 However, CNN's most prominent anchor was quick to reject the explosive reporting from The New York Post that shed\u00a0light on Hunter Biden's\u00a0questionable foreign business dealings before and after his father was in office as vice president.\u00a0 \"The rightwing is going crazy with all sorts of allegations about Biden and his family. Too disgusting to even repeat here,\" Tapper said during a panel discussion on Oct 22.\u00a0\"I mean, some of the ones I've seen from the president's son and some of\u00a0the president's supporters are just wildly unhinged.\"\u00a0 But now, weeks after the presidential election\u00a0as Biden prepares to become the 46th president, the subject of the Biden family's business ties appears to be fair game to Tapper.\u00a0 CNN'S JAKE TAPPER, DON LEMON GUSH OVER BIDEN INTERVIEW: HE SAID 'A LOT OF THE RIGHT ANSWERS' Even Tapper's colleague Don Lemon appeared surprised that the subject was mentioned following the interview.\u00a0 On Wednesday, Project Veritas released recordings of CNN company conference calls that confirmed suspicions of the network's concerted efforts to suppress the Hunter Biden story that was damaging to the Biden campaign after critics\u00a0observed a complete blackout of any coverage of the bombshell reporting.\u00a0 \"Obviously, we're not going with the New York Post story right now on Hunter Biden,\" CNN Political Director David Chalian\u00a0is heard saying during\u00a0a conference call on Oct. 14, the same day the Post released its first reports on Hunter Biden's emails.\u00a0Chalian later insisted the report\u00a0was \"giving its marching orders\"\u00a0to the \"rightwing echo chamber about what to talk about today.\" CNN BOSS RIPS 'USEFUL IDIOT' RUDY GIULIANI FOR PUSHING HUNTER BIDEN 'DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN,' AUDIOTAPE SHOWS Chalian, who also serves as a vice president, continued, \"Obviously, Hunter Biden's lawyer is quoted in the New York Post piece\u00a0and we'll just continue to report out this is the very stuff that the president was impeached over, this is the stuff that Senate Committees looked at and found nothing wrong in\u00a0Joe Biden's interactions with Ukrainians and now having an email that perhaps there was a meeting with someone from Burisma it seems. Rudy Giuliani's sort of 'dream-o-vision' of how to throw stuff at the wall in these closing days of the campaign.\"\u00a0 On the Oct. 23 call, the day after the final presidential debate where\u00a0President Trump\u00a0hammered Biden over the recent revelations involving his son, CNN President Jeff Zucker referred to the story as a \"rabbit hole\" that \"I don't think anybody outside of that [rightwing media] world understood last night\" and later suggested\u00a0the Wall Street Journal's reporting definitively\u00a0proves Biden had \"no role\" in his son's business dealings with China as a reason for CNN not to\u00a0pursue the story itself.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Zucker appeared to allude to the Hunter Biden email scandal in an Oct. 16 conference call released by Project Veritas on Tuesday. \u00a0 \"The Trump media, you know, moves immediately from -- OK, well, never mind -- the unmasking was, you know, found to be completely nonsensical, to the latest alleged scandal and expects everybody to just follow suit,\" Zucker told his staff. \"So, I don't think that we should be repeating unsubstantiated smears just because the right-wing media suggests that we should.\" \"The unmasking\" referenced by Zucker referred to the controversy involving top Obama administration officials, including now-President-elect Biden, requesting to know the identity of then-Trump national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn during the transition period following the 2016 election Zucker's message\u00a0appeared to have resonated with his star anchor, who the following week said the Hunter Biden allegations were \"too disgusting\" to repeat on-air.\u00a0 CNN did not respond to Fox News' multiple requests for comment.\u00a0",

But as he answered questions from reporters on Friday, Biden said he wouldn\u2019t make vaccines and masks mandatory. BIDEN TO CALL DURING INAUGURATION FOR 100 DAYS OF WEARING MASKS And the president-elect, who spoke\u00a0in his hometown of Wilmington, Del., called Friday\u2019s unemployment report \u201cgrim.\u201d He urged Congress and President Trump to immediately pass a COVID-19 relief measure and warned that \u201cthe future will be very bleak\u201d without such a deal. Biden was asked if taking the vaccine should be mandated for Americans. \u201cI don't think it should be mandatory, I wouldn't demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power -- it's like I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide,\u201d Biden replied. And he vowed that he\u2019d \u201cdo everything in my power as president of the United States to encourage people to do the right thing and when they do it, demonstrate that it matters. That\u2019s why I said in my inaugural speech I\u2019m going to ask people to commit to 100 days to wear a mask.\u201d WHERE THE CDC SAYS AMERICANS SHOULD WEAR A MASK The president-elect predicted that \u201cif people do it for 100 days in the middle of what will still be a raging crisis, and the vaccine is able to be distributed, they\u2019re going to see deaths drop off the edge. They\u2019re going to see hundreds of thousands of people not getting sick. And my hope is they\u2019ll then be inclined to say \u2018it\u2019s worth the patriotic duty to go ahead and protect other people.\u2019\u201d Biden emphasized that when it comes to distributing the vaccines across the country, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more that has to be done.\u201d He said that Trump administration officials have \u201cclued us in our their plan on how they plan to distribute the actual vaccine to the various states but there is no detailed plan that we\u2019ve seen anywhere as to how do you get the vaccine out of a container and into an injection syringe into somebody\u2019s arm. And it\u2019s going to be very difficult for that to be done and it\u2019s a very expensive proposition.\u201d Biden noted that he agrees with the priorities \u201claid out so far\u201d by the Trump administration that those who would receive the vaccines first would be \u201cfirst responders and those in nursing homes and in-home care, the first people on the list.\u201d But he added that \u201cthere has to be some equity in how this is distributed\u201d as he stressed that officials have to figure out how to get the vaccine to minority communities hard hit by the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d Biden added. And the president-elect touted that \u201cI think that my taking the vaccine and people seeing me take that vaccine is going to give some confidence.\u201d Taking aim at President Trump, Biden argued that \u201cit\u2019s going to take some effort to rebuild confidence in science because it\u2019s been so diminished in this administration thus far.\u201d More than 276,000 deaths throughout\u00a0the country have been tied to the coronavirus since the pandemic swept the nation in February and March, with more than 14.2 million COVID-19 cases in total. There has been a surge in cases throughout much of the nation during the past month. NEW JOBS REPORT SUGGESTS CORONAVIRUS SURGE THREATENING ECONOMIC RECOVERY Speaking hours after the Labor Department reported that jobs increased by 245,000 in November, down from 610,000 in October, Biden described the report as \u201cdire\u201d and \u201cgrim.\u201d  \u00a0\u201cIt shows an economy that\u2019s stalling,\u201d he said. But he said that if the government reacts now, \u201cwe can regain begin to regain momentum.\u201d But Biden warned that \u201cthere\u2019s no time to lose. Millions of people have lost their jobs or had their hours slashed. They\u2019ve lost their health insurance or are in danger of losing their health insurance. One in every six renters is behind in rent. One in four small businesses can\u2019t keep their doors open.\u201d Biden called on Congress and the president \u201cto act and act now\u201d and warned that \u201cif Congress and President Trump fail to act by the end of December, 12 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits they rely on. Merry Christmas.\u201d \u00a0\u201cIf we don\u2019t act now, the future will be very bleak. Americans need help and they need it now. And they need more to come early next year,\u201d he added. The president-elect said he was encouraged by a proposed $908 billion bipartisan framework in the Senate and said it showed that both parties can work together.  Biden said that coronavirus stimulus checks for. families \u201cmay be still in play.\u201d He added that \u201cI think it would be better if they had the $1,200\" payments to families. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the top two Democrats in Congress, have backed the deal heading into talks with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Biden twice dodged questions on whether he's talked yet with McConnell, the top Republican on Capitol Hill. Then-Vice President Biden and McConnell had a history of striking deals to avert fiscal catastrophes during the Obama administration. \u201cMcConnell knows me,\u201d Biden noted. \u201cHe knows I\u2019m straight as an arrow.\u201d Biden also characterized the bipartisan proposal as \u201cjust a down payment\u201d and once again promised to push for more coronavirus relief aid when his administration takes over next month. The president-elect was also asked about pressure from Democrats to name a more diverse cabinet and administration. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see significant diversity,\u201d Biden said. And he emphasized that he\u2019ll name the \u201csingle most diverse cabinet\u2026ever.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

    "article_text": "Biden to call for 100 days of masks after inauguration President-elect Joe Biden said during an interview Thursday that he plans to ask the American public to wear masks for 100 days, starting the day he is inaugurated, in order to drive down the number of coronavirus cases. Biden,\u00a0during an interview with CNN, said he will ask Americans to mask up, but only for a limited period. \"The first day I'm inaugurated I'm going to ask the public for 100 days to mask,\" Biden said. \"Just 100, not forever --\u00a0100 days.\" \"I think we'll see a significant reduction that occurs with vaccinations and masking\u00a0to drive down the numbers considerably.\" Biden's comments come a day after the U.S. recorded a new high in coronavirus-related fatalities on Wednesday at 2,804, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWNS BY STATE: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The nation \u2013\u00a0which has logged\u00a0more\u00a0than 14 million cases and more than 275,000 deaths since the pandemic began\u00a0\u2013\u00a0also recorded 200,070 new daily COVID-19 illnesses, though it did not surpass\u00a0a previous daily case record set Nov. 27 of 205,557. The record daily death toll coincides with news of a record number of hospitalized coronavirus patients, topping 100,000 on Tuesday. The grim milestone comes as health officials warned of surges tied to holiday travel and lockdown fatigue. Biden's comments also come as he urges lawmakers on Capitol Hill to get behind a bipartisan COVID-19 relief effort after a monthslong logjam to deliver much-sought aid as the tempestuous congressional session speeds to a close. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer of New York on Wednesday came out in support of an almost $1 trillion approach as the basis\u00a0for discussions. The announcement appeared aimed at budging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who so far has been unwilling to abandon a $550 billion Senate GOP plan that has failed twice this fall. The Democrats embraced a $908 billion approach from moderate Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, among others. It would establish a $300 per week jobless benefit, send $160 billion to help state and local governments, boost schools and universities, revive popular \u201cpaycheck protection\u201d subsidies for businesses, and bail out transit systems and airlines. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cIn the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,\u201d Pelosi and Schumer said. They said they would try to build upon the approach, which has support in the House from a bipartisan \u201cproblem solvers\u201d coalition. The statement was a significant concession by Pelosi and Schumer, who played hardball this fall during failed preelection discussions with the administration on a costlier bill. They wanted a more generous unemployment benefit and far more for state and local government. Their embrace of the $908 billion measure was a retreat from a secret $1.3 trillion offer the two Democrats gave McConnell just on Monday. It\u2019s another sign of urgency for additional COVID aid and economic stimulus as the economy struggles to recover from being slammed by the novel coronavirus. While the jobless rate isn\u2019t as high as was feared, the restaurant and airline industries are desperate for aid, as are other businesses, state and local officials, transit systems and the Postal Service, among others.

    "article_text": "Ratcliffe urges Biden to let Durham probe run its course, says more docs 'should be' declassified EXCLUSIVE:\u00a0Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe on Thursday urged President-elect Joe Biden to allow Special Counsel\u00a0John Durham's investigation into the origins of the Russia probe to run its course, while saying he hopes there will be \"folks held accountable that should be.\" Ratcliffe, during an interview with Fox News, also indicated that there are\u00a0\u201ca significant number of documents\u201d not within the intelligence community, but that \u201crelate to the counterintelligence investigation at the FBI and at the Justice Department\u201d that have not yet been declassified. \u201cI think it is possible that some of those would be, and should be,\u201d Ratcliffe said. Attorney General William Barr\u00a0made public Tuesday that U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham, who has been investigating the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, was appointed in October as special counsel to continue his probe in the next administration. BARR APPOINTS JOHN DURHAM SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE \u201cMy hope is that John Durham, with all of the documents that I have provided in connection with his investigation from the intelligence community, will provide the full accounting and for there to be folks held accountable that should be,\u201d Ratcliffe told Fox News. He added: \u201cI certainly hope that whoever is running the Justice Department in 2021 will allow these answers to be fully accounted for before the American people.\u201d Ratcliffe said the questions have \u201calready been answered.\u201d \u201cWas there an abuse of power? Legal authorities violated at the FISA court? Did crimes occur? An FBI lawyer has pled guilty in connection with all of that \u2014 so the answer is, it happened,\u201d Ratcliffe said.\u201cThe question now\u00a0is how far, and how deep, is it?\u201d Ratcliffe said. Ratcliffe, during his tenure as director of National Intelligence, has declassified a slew of documents, which allies of President Trump have cast as significant, citing their content as proof that the investigation into the president and his 2016 campaign was baseless. EXCLUSIVE: DNI RATCLIFFE URGES BIDEN TO 'BE HONEST' ABOUT CHINA, NOT TO POLITICIZE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE \u201cThe documents I have declassified reveal that there are folks in the Biden \u2014 or, the Obama-Biden administration, senior national security folks that were aware of the fact that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign \u2014 no intelligence that supported that,\u201d Ratcliffe told Fox News. \"Remember, we were told, the idea, when I first\u00a0raised the issue of abuse at the FISA\u00a0court, officials said ideas of FISA abuse is a bunch of nonsense, but now very clearly that's proven to be the case \u2014 those violations did occur,\" Ratcliffe said. \"And all of those\u00a0national security\u00a0officials in the Obama-Biden administration,\u00a0like [former FBI Director James] Comey and [Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew]\u00a0McCabe and [Former Deputy Attorney General Sally]\u00a0Yates and others are now running the opposite direction saying oh, had we only known.\"\u00a0 In May, prior to Ratcliffe\u2019s Senate confirmation, acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell cleared for release more than 6,000 pages of transcripts of interviews from the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s long-running Russia investigation. Fox News first reported that top Obama officials, like former DNI James Clapper, testified that he \u201cnever saw any direct empirical evidence\u201d of collusion or a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election. HOUSE INTEL TRANSCRIPTS SHOW TOP OBAMA OFFICIALS HAD 'NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE' OF TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION\u00a0 Meanwhile, Ratcliffe, pointed to other intelligence to \u201creflect that the Trump-Russia collusion was a narrative created by Democrats \u2014 specifically the Clinton campaign.\u201d Ratcliffe was referring to declassified handwritten notes\u00a0belonging to former CIA Director John Brennan, which appeared to show Hillary Clinton\u2019s purported \u201cplan\u201d to tie then-candidate Donald Trump to Russia as \u201ca means of distracting the public form her use of a private email server\u201d ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Ratcliffe also declassified a CIA memo sent to then-FBI Director James Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok, referring to Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d to the bureau for potential investigative action. Ratcliffe noted that most of the intelligence community documents that could be declassified \u201chave been, either by myself or Ric Grenell.\u201d DECLASSIFIED TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE DOCUMENTS TO DATE: WHAT TO KNOW \u201cThere are other documents that I\u2019ve provided to the special counsel that can\u2019t be declassified because they might prejudice his investigation, and those documents that still have sources and methods that can\u2019t be declassified at any point in time,\u201d he explained. Ratcliffe, in October, said that he provided more than 1,000 pages of material to the Justice Department to support Durham\u2019s investigation. Barr notified the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, in a letter dated Dec. 1 obtained by Fox News, that Durham would be special counsel this week. \u201cOn May 13, 2019, I directed John Durham, U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, to investigate certain intelligence and law-enforcement activities surrounding the 2016 presidential election,\u201d Barr wrote. \u201cAlthough I had expected Mr. Durham to complete his work by the summer of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as additional information he uncovered, prevented him from doing so. \u201cIn advance of the presidential election, I decided to appoint Mr. Durham as a Special Counsel to provide him and his team with the assurance that they could complete their work, without regard to the outcome of the election,\u201d Barr wrote, adding that he appointed Durham with \u201cthe powers and authority of a Special Counsel\u201d on Oct. 19. In a scope order, obtained by Fox News, Barr stated that Durham\u00a0as special counsel \u201cis authorized to investigate whether any federal official, employee, or any other person or entity violated the law in connection with the intelligence, counter-intelligence, or law-enforcement activities directed at the 2016 presidential campaigns, individuals associated with those campaigns, and individuals associated with the administration of President Donald J. Trump, including but not limited to Crossfire Hurricane and the investigation of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III.\u201d DURHAM MOVING 'FULL SPEED AHEAD' Under U.S. code, the special counsel would produce a \u201cconfidential report\u201d and is ordered to \u201csubmit to the Attorney General a final report, and such interim reports as he deems appropriate in a form that will permit public dissemination.\u201d Fox News reported last week that Durham was moving \"full speed ahead\" with his investigation after Election Day.\u00a0 Another source told Fox News that his investigation \u201cis definitely still happening,\u201d despite radio silence coming from the U.S. attorney from Connecticut. Durham\u2019s investigation has produced one criminal charge so far, against former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who was accused of altering an email related to the surveillance of a former Trump campaign aide. That prosecution, though, did not allege a broader conspiracy within the FBI, and the conduct it involved had largely been laid out in a Justice Department inspector general report from last December. After the Clinesmith charge, Durham\u2019s team went silent. Two sources familiar with the investigation told Fox News over the summer that Durham was not finished with several lines of investigation, which he believed were \u201ccritical.\u201d One source told Fox News Durham had been \u201cfeeling more pressure to get this done and wrapped up\u201d over the summer, but said that Durham \u201cdoes not want this to be viewed political,\u201d and would likely \u201cpunt it to after the election,\u201d which he ultimately did. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Durham was appointed by Barr last year to investigate the origins of the FBI\u2019s Russia probe, shortly after special counsel Robert Mueller completed his yearlong investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election. Mueller\u2019s investigation yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 election.",

    "article_text": "Hyperpartisan CNN heaps praise on Biden team's transparency: 'No B.S.' about injury Liberal networks MSNBC and CNN took different approaches to news that President-elect Joe Biden sustained a hairline fracture in his right foot, as the latter\u00a0avoided criticism of the incoming administration stalling to inform reporters and managed to attack President Trump instead. MSNBC anchor\u00a0Andrea Mitchell scolded the Biden team Monday for its\u00a0lack of transparency about\u00a0the\u00a0president-elect's foot injury, which occurred\u00a0Saturday. The veteran MSNBC host complained it \"wasn't until Sunday\" that the White House press pool found out\u00a0Biden was \"going somewhere,\" which ended up being a visit to the doctor. She suggested it should not have taken so long for the public to find out. CNN USES BIDEN\u2019S FOOT INJURY TO FAWN OVER TRANSPARENCY OF INCOMING ADMINISTRATION \"They weren\u2019t as forthcoming as you would hope they would be with the press pool that\u2019s supposed to cover him,\" Mitchell said. PBS White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor, who was a panelist on Mitchell\u2019s program, agreed, saying there has already been some \u201ctension\u201d between Biden and the press because the president-elect often goes out in public after calling a \u201clid,\u201d which indicates he\u2019s done making appearances for the day. \u201cThe transition wasn\u2019t giving reporters the heads-up they would need,\u201d Alcindor said. While journalists from MSNBC and PBS were truthful about the situation, hyperpartisan CNN took a much different approach and used the foot injury as an opportunity to praise Biden and his team. MSNBC'S ANDREA MITCHELL HITS BIDEN TEAM FOR NOT BEING 'FORTHCOMING' ABOUT PRESIDENT-ELECT'S FOOT INJURY CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza wrote a glowing piece headlined, \u201cWhy Joe Biden's broken foot reveals how different his White House will be from Donald Trump's.\u201d The CNN pundit noted that Trump was famously secretive about an unscheduled 2019 visit to Walter Reed Medical Center but Biden\u2019s staffers \u201cquickly\u201d updated reporters on his injury. \u201cNotice the difference? Now, I -- and probably you -- don't know or care all that much about Joe Biden's \u2018lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones.\u2019 But that isn't really the point,\u201d Cillizza wrote. \u201cThe point is this: Transparency in matters of health and, well, everything else, is fundamental to a functioning democracy,\u201d Cillizza continued. \u201cAnd we have had the opposite of that for these last four years.\u201d CNN host Chris Cuomo, the younger brother of embattled Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, continued the lavish praise of Biden on Monday night. \u201cWe just got the straight truth about [the foot injury]. No lie, no deny\u2026 there was no B.S. There was no blocking us from the reason that Trump was rushed to a hospital, no fugazi\u00a0doctors with absurd, lauding statements about Biden being superhuman, strongest pinky toe in history. Just the truth,\u201d Cuomo said without acknowledging the nearly 24-hour delay that even MSNBC complained about. Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson isn\u2019t surprised that CNN would ignore Biden-related issues and stick with its anti-Trump agenda. CNN REPORTER DRAWS RIDICULE FOR CONGRATULATING HERSELF, COLLEAGUES ON TRUMP ANSWERING QUESTIONS \"Whenever there was even a hint of illness for Donald Trump, the mainstream media put a negative political spin on it, portraying Trump as reckless or secretive,\u00a0or both. Now that Joe Biden has a mild injury, CNN still is putting a\u00a0negative political spin on it -- against Trump. Some habits are hard to break,\" Jacobson told Fox News. While Mitchell and Alcindor at least acknowledged the Biden team\u2019s delay in transparency, former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders doesn\u2019t think the mainstream media will hold the president-elect accountable anytime soon. \u201cMy guess is they\u2019ll give him a free pass like they\u2019ve done on everything else in the campaign over the last year and a half. They don\u2019t push for questions, we saw them celebrating, a group of journalists in the press pool celebrating they got Donald Trump to answer a question,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d referring to a picture tweeted by CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins last week. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cHe\u2019s the most accessible president in U.S. history, getting him to answer a question is not a heroic feat,\u201d she said. \u201cBut getting Joe Biden to answer a question would be. I hope that they will push him, hold him accountable, and ask him real questions.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Joseph A. Wulfsohn contributed to this report.",

Psaki, who served in former President Obama's State Department, was gifted the\u00a0pink\u00a0shapka, or fur hat, by her then-counterpart, spokesperson Maria Zakharova,\u00a0in Russia. A photo from 2014 shows Psaki wearing the hat while posing\u00a0with then-Secretary of State John Kerry, who has been appointed to serve as Biden's \"climate czar,\" and Zakharova. Also standing next to Psaki is Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov, who caught attention for an Oval Office meeting in 2017 where President Trump controversially shared U.S. intelligence with him. The hammer and sickle has come to represent communist movements around the world. It also was a feature of the flag for the former Soviet Union, which spawned from Russia's communist revolution and engaged in decades of brinksmanship in a \"cold war\" with the U.S. It has also become a symbol for brutal economic and political repression that occurs under communist regimes. BIDEN CHOOSES ALL-FEMALE SENIOR WHITE HOUSE PRESS TEAM Biden's transition team noted to Fox News that gift exchanges are common on foreign trips, referencing how Kerry previously gave Lavrov two Idaho potatoes during a meeting in Paris.\u00a0 Psaki's attire faced pushback from the Trump campaign on Monday.

    "article_text": "CNN uses Biden\u2019s foot injury to fawn over transparency of incoming administration President-elect Joe Biden sustained a hairline fracture in his right foot while playing with\u00a0one of his dogs on Sunday, and CNN used the injury to fawn over how transparent it thinks the incoming administration will compared to President Trump's.\u00a0 \u201cThe transparency coming from Biden's transition team about hairline fractures in the President-elect's foot suggests that the effort by the Trump White House to actively obfuscate when asked basic questions about the President's health is over,\u201d CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza wrote. JOE BIDEN'S DOCTOR GIVES UPDATE AFTER THE 78-YEAR-OLD GETS HURT PLAYING WITH DOG MAJOR Biden's team first confirmed his injury, saying that the 78-year-old twisted his ankle while playing with his dog\u00a0Major\u00a0and would be examined by an orthopedist \"out of an abundance of caution\" then provided an update later in the day. \"Initial X-rays are reassuring that there is no obvious fracture and he will be getting an additional CT for more detailed imaging,\" Dr. Kevin O'Connor said in a statement. \"Follow-up CT scan confirmed hairline (small) fractures of President-elect Biden's lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones, which are in the mid-foot. It is anticipated that he will likely require a walking boot for several weeks.\"\u00a0 Reporters covering the president-elect were not afforded the opportunity to see Biden enter the doctor's office, despite multiple requests. While Trump was criticized at every step during his presidency, criticism of Biden\u2019s team not allowing reporters to see him enter the doctor\u2019s office were sparse. Once the injury was diagnosed, the hyper-partisan CNN used it as the impetus to bash the Trump administration. CNN REPORTER CALLS FOR TWITTER TO TAKE CENSORSHIP FURTHER, LABEL TRUMP'S ACCOUNT AS DISINFORMATION Cillizza praised the way Biden\u2019s team handled the injury with a column headlined, \u201cWhy Joe Biden's broken foot reveals how different his White House will be from Donald Trump's.\u201d The CNN pundit noted that Trump was famously secretive about an unscheduled 2019 visit to Walter Reed Medical Center but Biden\u2019s staffers \u201cquickly\u201d updated reporters on his injury. \u201cNotice the difference? Now, I -- and probably you -- don't know or care all that much about Joe Biden's \u2018lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones.\u2019 But that isn't really the point,\u201d Cillizza wrote. \u201cThe point is this: Transparency in matters of health and, well, everything else, is fundamental to a functioning democracy,\u201d Cillizza continued. \u201cAnd we have had the opposite of that for these last four years.\u201d DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall thinks CNN and other mainstream outlets need to take it easy when it comes to applauding Biden for coming forward with details. \u201cThe traditional media should not be giving the Biden camp so much praise for transparency regarding an injured foot. It is easy to manage transparency when dealing with a foot injury while also mentioning a family pet. Plenty of good optics here,\u201d McCall told Fox News. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cMore than sitting back to take detailed medical reports from the Biden team about hairline fractures in a foot, perhaps the press should explore more about why the Biden campaign put a lid on so many days during the campaign, or even inquire more about the circumstances under which the former vice president was in a position to get hurt by his dog,\u201d McCall added. \u201cOf course, the media will look for every opportunity to compare transparency of the Biden camp to the Trump administration, but doing so on the basis of a foot injury and a walking boot is quite the waste of time.\u201d \u00a0 The Associated Press and Fox News\u2019 Bradford Betz contributed to this report.\u00a0",

    "article_text": "Arizona certifies Biden as election winner, with Wisconsin following hours later President Trump suffered another setback in his push to overturn his defeat in the presidential election,\u00a0as Arizona\u00a0on Monday certified President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the state. The results of the election were certified by Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who's a Democrat, with GOP Gov. Doug Ducey,\u00a0Republican state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, and state Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert Brutinel in attendance. TRUMP PRESSES 'HAPLESS' REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA TO OVERULE SECRETARY OF STATE Hours after the certifying of the vote in Arizona, Wisconsin finalized their results, becoming the last of the remaining contested battleground states to do so. Biden was projected the winner in Arizona on Election Night by Fox News and The Associated Press. The other major news networks projected Biden as the winner in the state a week later. Biden ended up carrying the state by just over 10,000 votes, or three-tenths of 1 percent of the vote. Eleven electoral votes were up for grabs in Arizona. The former vice president became the first Democrat since President Bill Clinton in 1996 to carry Arizona, and only the third since President Harry Truman in 1948. In Wisconsin, state Elections Commission chair Ann Jacobs signed \"the official state determination of the results of the Nov. 3, 2020 election.\" The move, which confirmed Biden won Wisconsin by just over 20,000 votes, came a day after the completion of a partial recount requested by the Trump campaign. The recount slightly altered the results in Biden\u2019s favor. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers certified the election results later in the day. That kicked off a five-day window for the president to file a lawsuit in Wisconsin. On Saturday, Trump said he would bring a lawsuit in the state by Tuesday. The actions by both states are the latest setback for the president, who refuses to concede to Biden, more than three weeks after Fox News, the Associated Press and other news networks projected that Biden would win enough electoral votes to defeat Trump and become president-elect. Trump's legal team filed a spate of lawsuits in many of the key battlegrounds, in hopes of delaying the certification of the election, but the tactics have been unsuccessful to date. The recount in Wisconsin, as well as one requested by Trump in Georgia, also failed so far to alter Biden's victories. Trump's defeat in Arizona -- since the margin was greater than a tenth of 1 percent -- doesn't qualify for an automatic recount. While there's no provision in the state for a losing candidate to request a recount, Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward has indicated the state party will file a challenge to the results after they were certified. A lawsuit by the state GOP to force a hand recount of some ballots in Maricopa County, the state's largest, was dismissed on Nov. 19, due to no evidence of voter fraud. TRUMP BLASTS LEGAL SETBACKS TO HIS PUSH TO OVERTURN HIS ELECTION DEFEAT The top two attorneys steering Trump's legal efforts -- Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis -- appeared Monday in Phoenix with a group of GOP state lawmakers, for a \"fact-finding\" meeting to discuss potential fraud in the election. The two lawyers took part in a similar meeting last week in Pennsylvania, another state where Biden narrowly defeated the president. Pennsylvania, as well as the battlegrounds of Michigan, Nevada\u00a0and Georgia, have also certified their election results over the past week and a half. In his first interview since this month's election, Trump once again claimed that the \"election was a fraud; it was a rigged election.\" \"We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account,\" the president charged without backing up his claim, in a conversation with FOX\u00a0Business' Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that his legal bid to overturn the election results \"probably\" wouldn't reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has been the goal of his legal team.

In an email sent to John Podesta, former chief of staff for Bill Clinton,\u00a0on Oct. 20, 2015, Tanden clearly stated that she had more confidence in Hillary Clinton than Biden. \u201cThe good thing about a Biden run is that he would make Hillary look so much better,\u201d Tanden said. \u201cWhat a mess today. Thanks for today and last night.\u201d Tanden was\u00a0likely referencing an event\u00a0honoring former Vice President Walter Mondale in Washington, where Biden critiqued Clinton. GEORGIA'S SECRETARY OF STATE SOUNDS ALARM AHEAD OF RUNOFF ELECTIONS At the\u00a0Oct. 20, 2015 event,\u00a0Biden portrayed his own leadership during the Obama administration as more critical to its successes than Clinton\u2019s as former secretary of state, and rebuked her as \u201cna\u00efve\u201d for calling Republicans her principal enemy. \u201cIt is possible, it is necessary to end this notion that the enemy is the other party,\u201d Biden told the crowd of Washington notables at the Mondale\u00a0gala. \u201cEnd this notion that it is na\u00efve to think we can speak well of the other party and cooperation. What is na\u00efve is to think it is remotely possible to govern this country unless we can. That is what is na\u00efve.\u201d The week prior to this event, Clinton was asked to name which enemy she has made in her career that she was most proud of and responded with a list. \u201cWell, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians; probably the Republicans,\u201d she said. JUDGE HALTS 3 ATLANTA-AREA COUNTIES FROM ERASING DOMINION VOTING MACHINE DATA Biden considered running against Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination around this time. He named her in his speech at the gala, saying she was \u201cgreat\u201d in her post as the nation\u2019s top diplomat, but couldn\u2019t carry the same weight speaking to foreign leaders that he could. The day after Tanden\u2019s email was sent, Biden announced he would not be running against Clinton for the Democratic nomination for president.
