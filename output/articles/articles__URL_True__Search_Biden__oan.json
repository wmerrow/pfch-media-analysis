    "article_text": "Maricopa County GOP chairwoman testifies she saw votes for President Trump flipped for Biden The GOP vice chairwoman of Maricopa County, Arizona said she saw ballots changed from a vote for President Trump to a vote for Joe Biden on election night. Linda Brickman testified before Arizona state legislators on Monday, stating that she witnessed votes being entered into the Dominion system automatically changed to reflect a vote for Biden. She said she was threatened and barred from the counting room after telling her supervisor what she saw. Despite multiple witnesses coming forward with similar stories, counters were reportedly never told whether any action had been taken to correct the miscount.  Maricopa County is among the largest in the nation with more than 2 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cI read her a Trump Republican ballot and as soon as she entered it into the system, the ballot defaulted on the screen to a Biden Democratic ballot,\u201d explained the GOP vice chairwoman. Brickman said her purpose of appearing at the hearing was to speak the truth and protect the integrity of the election.",
