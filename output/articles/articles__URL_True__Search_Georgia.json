    "article_text": "In Georgia Debate, Kelly Loeffler Won\u2019t Say Trump Lost ATLANTA \u2014 In a televised debate on Sunday night, Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Georgia Republican, declined to say that President Trump had lost the election, arguing instead that the president had \u201cevery legal recourse available\u201d to pursue his baseless assertion that the vote in Georgia was rigged against him. Ms. Loeffler, whose runoff race is one of two in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate on Jan. 5, has emerged as a staunch defender of Mr. Trump. She used the debate to label her Democratic opponent, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, as a \u201cradical liberal\u201d more than a dozen times over the course of an hour. Mr. Warnock criticized Ms. Loeffler, one of the richest members of the Senate, for making a large number of stock trades after she attended a briefing on the coronavirus in January. Ms. Loeffler did not answer directly when asked whether members of Congress should be barred from trading stocks. \u201cLook, what\u2019s at stake here in this election is the American dream,\u201d Ms. Loeffler said, calling the question of her stock trades \u201ca left-wing media lie.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is an attack on every single Georgian who gets up every day to work hard to provide a better life for their family.\u201d Ms. Loeffler\u2019s trades and those of two other senators were investigated by the Justice Department, but the department announced in May that it would not pursue insider trading charges against them. A Senate Ethics Committee investigation also found no evidence of violations. The debate came one day after Mr. Trump held a rally in Georgia in which he falsely claimed that he had won the state \u2014 and after he made a phone call to Gov. Brian Kemp, asking him to call a special session of the Republican-controlled legislature so that lawmakers could appoint new electors who would subvert the will of the state\u2019s voters when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 14. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Kemp and Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, both Republicans, said that a special session would not be called in Georgia, reiterating a position they had taken previously. \u201cDoing this in order to select a separate slate of presidential electors is not an option that is allowed under state or federal law,\u201d they said. Mr. Kemp and Mr. Duncan added that state law allows the legislature only to \u201cdirect an alternative method for choosing presidential electors if the election was not able to be held on the date set by federal law.\u201d Ms. Loeffler and Georgia\u2019s other Republican senator, David Perdue, have both stuck by the president, attending the rally with him in Valdosta, Ga., on Saturday. But prominent Republicans are worried that Mr. Trump\u2019s airing of his grievances about his loss in the state might convince his supporters that Georgia\u2019s voting system is indeed rigged and that they should sit out the crucially important runoff elections. Losses by both Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue would hand control of the Senate to the Democrats. At the debate, Ms. Loeffler hammered repeatedly on her theme that Mr. Warnock \u2014 the pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached \u2014 was dangerously out of step with Georgia values. She said that he had criticized the police from the pulpit and advocated \u201csocialism\u201d and abortion rights. Mr. Warnock also portrayed Ms. Loeffler as being out of touch, bringing up her stock trades and criticizing her initial opposition to Congress\u2019s relief package for people and businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. (Ms. Loeffler eventually voted for the $2 trillion package in March.) Mr. Warnock also sought to make the case, late in the debate, that Ms. Loeffler was a radical in her own right, noting that she \u201cwelcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist,\u201d a likely reference to Representative-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has espoused the movement\u2019s pro-Trump conspiracy theories in the past. The debate came at the end of a day made particularly tense by Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion, at his Saturday night rally, that the presidential election had been \u201crigged\u201d in Georgia, a state that two recounts have shown he lost. The latest tally has Joseph R. Biden Jr. winning by about 12,000 votes. Georgia has already seen remarkable Republican infighting over Mr. Trump\u2019s push to reverse the results of the race. Violent threats against elections workers have grown so problematic that a top state elections official, Gabriel Sterling, a Republican, last week asked the president to check his inflammatory language. On Sunday morning, high-ranking Georgia officials from Mr. Trump\u2019s own party pushed back, yet again, against the president\u2019s bogus assertions of widespread electoral fraud. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who has become one of the chief targets of Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath in recent days, went on the ABC program \u201cThis Week\u201d and addressed the president\u2019s phone call to Mr. Kemp. Mr. Raffensperger, who, like Mr. Kemp, supported Mr. Trump in the election, said that holding a special session would amount to \u201cnullifying the will of the people.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day, the voice of the people were spoken,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed as a conservative Republican also.\u201d The other runoff race in Georgia pits Mr. Perdue, a former corporate executive, against Jon Ossoff, a 33-year-old Democrat and documentary filmmaker. Mr. Perdue declined to attend a debate with Mr. Ossoff on Sunday, which resulted in a strange 30-minute session in which Mr. Ossoff faced off against an empty lectern. Mr. Ossoff called Mr. Perdue a \u201ccoward\u201d for not debating and criticized what he described as the senator\u2019s early understatement of the threat posed by the coronavirus. \u201cThe reason that we are losing thousands of people per day to this virus is because of the arrogance of politicians like David Perdue,\u201d Mr. Ossoff said. \u201cSo arrogant that he disregarded public health expertise, and so arrogant that he\u2019s not with us here today to answer questions.\u201d He added, \u201cHe believes the Senate seat belongs to him.\u201d Standing alone on the debate stage, Mr. Ossoff took aim, as he has in the past, at Mr. Perdue\u2019s own controversial stock trades, which prompted Mr. Ossoff in a previous debate to call Mr. Perdue a \u201ccrook.\u201d The New York Times has reported that the Justice Department investigated but declined to charge Mr. Perdue for possible insider trading over his sale of more than $1 million worth of stock in a financial-analysis firm. The Times and other outlets have also documented numerous instances in which Mr. Perdue traded stocks in companies that stood to benefit from policies before committees and subcommittees on which he serves. \u201cHis blatant abuse of his power and privilege to enrich himself is disgraceful,\u201d Mr. Ossoff said. Mr. Perdue has previously said he has done nothing wrong. At one point in Ms. Loeffler\u2019s debate with Mr. Warnock, she asked him about his arrest in 2002 for obstructing law enforcement officials who were conducting a child abuse investigation at a summer camp in Maryland that was affiliated with Mr. Warnock\u2019s church at the time. Mr. Warnock responded that he was \u201cworking at trying to make sure that young people, who were being questioned by law enforcement, had the benefit of counsel, a lawyer or a parent.\u201d He added, \u201cThe law enforcement officers actually later thanked me for my cooperation and for helping them.\u201d The website PolitiFact and others have noted that the charges were dismissed by a judge after a prosecutor said there had been a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d with Mr. Warnock, who had been \u201cvery helpful\u201d with the investigation. Mr. Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia was a remarkable upset for Democrats in a state that has been reliably Republican for years. The result sent a shock wave through the state\u2019s conservative establishment. Last week, a group of prominent Georgia Republicans, including former Gov. Nathan Deal, released an open letter arguing that Republicans need to heal their divisions, unify their party and focus on the runoffs if they are to maintain control of the Senate. Mr. Trump\u2019s war with Georgia\u2019s Republican leadership over the state\u2019s election results continues to put Republicans who oversaw the election in the position of defending the integrity of the voting system. \u201cThe president\u2019s statements are false,\u201d Mr. Sterling, the elections official, said in an appearance on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThey are misinformation. They are stoking anger and fear among his supporters \u2014 and hell, I voted for him.\u201d Mr. Trump has raised a flurry of claims to try to undermine the results, railing against vote-counting machines and falsely asserting that mail-in ballots are rife with fraud. Mr. Sterling gained widespread attention last week for directly calling out Mr. Trump at an emotional news conference, during which he condemned the spread of spurious claims surrounding the election and the silence of Republicans who were refusing to challenge it. On Sunday, Mr. Sterling reiterated his outrage and his disappointment, particularly in Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler, who for the most part have stood by Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican,\u201d Mr. Sterling said. \u201cWe need to hold on to the Senate, so I\u2019m still going to vote for them. But I\u2019m not happy with how they\u2019ve conducted themselves in this particular situation.\u201d Richard Fausset reported from Atlanta, and Rick Rojas from Nashville.",

    "article_text": "At Rally for Georgia Senators, Trump Focuses on His Own Grievances VALDOSTA, Ga. \u2014 One month before a pair of Georgia runoffs that will determine the Senate majority, President Trump used a rally for the Republican senators on Saturday to complain about his own loss last month, insisting he would still prevail and, with notably less ardor, encouraging voters here to re-elect the two lawmakers. Taking the stage for his first rally as a lame duck president, Mr. Trump immediately, and falsely, claimed victory in the presidential race. \u201cYou know we won Georgia, just so you understand,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump lost this state by just under 12,000 votes to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., who won the White House with 306 electoral votes. But the president has persisted in his baseless claims that the final outcome remains in doubt. \u201cThey cheated and rigged our presidential election, but we\u2019ll still win,\u201d Mr. Trump said, offering no evidence but nonetheless prompting about 10,000 supporters gathered on the tarmac at a regional airport to chant, \u201cStop the Steal!\u201d Speaking for an hour and 40 minutes, the president did read a series of scripted lines about the two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, and repeatedly urged his supporters in Georgia to vote next month, even mentioning the deadlines for the mail-in ballots he has so often scorned. Yet he embedded those dutiful remarks of support in a deep thicket of conspiracy-mongering about his defeat and even aired a lengthy montage of video of clips from the conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network, which also depicted a sinister plot of electoral theft. Before he arrived in Valdosta, the president made no attempt to disguise his central priority as it relates to Georgia: overturning his loss in the state. He began the day with a telephone call with Gov. Brian Kemp, ostensibly to offer his condolences to the governor about the death in a car accident of a young man who was close to Mr. Kemp\u2019s family. But in truth, Mr. Trump used the call to urge Mr. Kemp, a Republican, to call the state legislature into session so the G.O.P. majorities could appoint new electors who would subvert the will of the state\u2019s voters when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 14. He has also called on Mr. Kemp to order an audit of signatures on ballots. At the rally, Mr. Trump amplified the critique he had been making of Mr. Kemp much of the day on Twitter, all but demanding that the governor overturn the will of the voters for him. \u201cYour governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing,\u201d the president said. \u201cStop it very easily.\u201d The crowd booed when he invoked Mr. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the two Georgia Republicans Mr. Trump has been demanding abet his effort to overturn Georgia\u2019s results. And they cheered when he turned to Representative Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican and Trump loyalist, and suggested he challenge Mr. Kemp in a gubernatorial primary in 2022. The president called the January races \u201cthe most important congressional runoff probably in American history\u201d and lashed the Democratic nominees, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, as \u201cfar-left liberals.\u201d But he didn\u2019t unspool the most biting attacks on them until about an hour into his remarks, and it was later still that he brought Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler to the stage for brief remarks. Mr. Perdue was nearly drowned out by the audience, which showered him with a \u201cFight for Trump\u201d chant that only grew louder when the two candidates handed the microphone back to the president. The president\u2019s supporters will not tolerate anything less than total fealty toward him. Mr. Trump\u2019s persistent lament about what he described as the \u201crigged\u201d election illustrated the quandary for Republicans. With Mr. Trump sowing distrust in Georgia\u2019s voting system, railing against the vote-counting machines the state used and falsely asserting that mail-in ballots were rife with fraud, he\u2019s giving Republicans in the state reason to question both voting by mail and in-person voting. If that prompts even a modest number of Republicans to sit out the Senate runoffs, especially in rural areas where Mr. Trump\u2019s support is strongest, it could be enough to alter the electoral math in the evenly divided state and tip the races to the Democrats. The president repeatedly sought to encourage Georgians to participate in the runoffs in the same breaths in which he railed against his own loss, offering a jarring, two-speeches-in-one presentation. \u201cYou got to get out and vote,\u201d he said just moments after venting that Republicans were purportedly \u201cnot nearly as vicious\u201d as Democrats when it came to stealing elections. In Valdosta, 250 miles south of Atlanta, supporters of the president began arriving by noon for the evening rally. Many of them had crossed the nearby state line from Florida and thus could not vote in the Senate races. The music, the red-white-and-blue stagecraft and Mr. Trump\u2019s heavily anticipated arrival were all familiar. But he showed little joy, and much of his speech was dedicated to nursing his grievances and was often reminiscent of the rambling, misinformation-filled, 45-minute video he delivered from the White House earlier in the week. \u201cI got more votes than any sitting president in history,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The president\u2019s willingness to campaign Saturday night in heavily conservative South Georgia \u2014 far from the Atlanta-area voters who rejected him last month \u2014 heartened Republican officials, who have been lobbying him to intervene in the runoffs in support of Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue. But aides worried, presciently, in the days leading to the appearance that he would go off script and attack Mr. Kemp, who has become the primary target of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter vitriol. Hoping to pacify Mr. Trump after Saturday\u2019s phone call, Mr. Kemp noted on Twitter that he had already called for an audit of the signatures on mail ballots \u201cto restore confidence in our election process.\u201d But Mr. Kemp\u2019s office has also said the governor does not have the power to unilaterally order a signature audit. Mr. Kemp did not attend the rally Saturday night because of the death of the family friend. Before Mr. Trump landed in Valdosta, Republicans took pains to emphasize the task at hand: the January runoffs. A mammoth video screen directed attendees to \u201cRequest Your Absentee Ballot Right Now!\u201d and directed them to the website to do so. And Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue both addressed the audience well before Air Force One touched down on a mild late autumn night. During a speech by Ms. Loeffler, who addressed the crowd nearly two hours before Mr. Trump spoke, the \u201cStop the steal\u201d chant broke out in the audience \u2014 in the cadence of the familiar \u201cLock her up\u201d chants that were popular during Mr. Trump\u2019s first run. Ms. Loeffler sought to redirect the crowd\u2019s energy to the runoff elections and away from the president\u2019s attempts to subvert the election results. \u201cYou\u2019re going to vote, right?\u201d she said. \u201cIf you vote, we will win. If you don\u2019t, we will lose America and what it\u2019s founded on.\u201d But as Elton John\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night\u2019s Alright (For Fighting)\u201d blared in advance of Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance, it was far from clear whom the crowd was more intent on directing its hostility toward \u2014 Democrats or the Georgia Republicans the president is scapegoating for his loss in the state. And outside the event, there were few indicators that the purpose of the rally was to elect Georgia\u2019s two Republican senators. Trump signs were ubiquitous, and the merchandisers outside were selling only Trump gear. The challenge for Republicans was evident in remarks from Mr. Perdue, who veered between encouraging the thousands in attendance to vote in the upcoming runoff and defending Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to advance his claims of fraud. \u201cI\u2019m going to fight for this president until he gets every ballot counted correctly and every illegal ballot thrown out,\u201d Mr. Perdue said. At the same time, he framed January\u2019s runoffs as a final chance for Republicans to issue a check against a Democratic administration. \u201cIf we win Georgia, we save America,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd thanks to you, we\u2019ll make sure the road to socialism never goes through the state of Georgia.\u201d Many in the audience had not accepted that Mr. Biden would be the next president. Jason Kresckey, who attended the rally with his wife, said he wanted to show support for the president. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s not going away,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that whole movement that he created was a movement that inspired a certain population of people. I just don\u2019t think that feeling is going anywhere soon.\u201d Michael D. Shear contributed reporting from Washington.",

    "article_text": "Native Americans Helped Flip Arizona. Can They Mobilize in Georgia? Marian McCormick lives in Georgia, as do 2,700 other members of the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe. She knows that comes as a surprise to some people. \u201cHere in Georgia, they tend to think that Native Americans were all removed,\u201d said Ms. McCormick, the principal chief of the tribe, which is based in Whigham. More than 180 years ago, as part of the Trail of Tears, the United States military drove thousands of Cherokee and Muscogee people off the land they had lived on for centuries and marched them to what is now Oklahoma. Today, the federal government doesn\u2019t recognize Ms. McCormick\u2019s tribe, or any other in the state. But nearly 150,000 Native Americans still live in Georgia, by the Native voting rights group Four Directions\u2019s estimate. They receive few government services and tend not to participate in nontribal elections, both because they face structural barriers \u2014 like hard-to-reach polling places and lack of voter ID \u2014 and because of the mistrust built by brutality and broken promises. Of the estimated 100,000 who are of voting age, only about 15,000 are registered to vote. Organizers and tribal leaders recognize that if even a few thousand more Native Americans were inspired and able to vote in Georgia, they could play a meaningful political role in a closely divided state where two runoff elections on Jan. 5 will decide which party controls the Senate. Buoyed by remarkable Native American turnout in other states last month, advocates are trying to make that happen at breakneck speed. Ms. McCormick recently spoke with OJ Semans, a co-founder of Four Directions, which is nonpartisan. They agreed to begin a get-out-the-vote campaign with the Cherokee of Georgia and the Georgia Tribe of Eastern Cherokee, two tribes that, like the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe, are recognized by the state. They also plan to press the Senate candidates \u2014 Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both Republicans, and their Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock \u2014 to address issues important to Native Americans. Increasing turnout among members of a marginalized community in a month is a tall order, and the deadline to register to vote in the runoffs is even sooner: Dec. 7. The foundations that groups like Four Directions have spent years building in other states \u2014 the networks of volunteers and relationships with tribes \u2014 are not so well established in Georgia, and Native Americans there are not as heavily concentrated on tribal land. But the examples other states set this year could provide a road map, even if the reward is farther off than January. Consider Arizona, which flipped blue in a presidential election for the first time in 24 years. Based on a New York Times analysis of precinct data, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. received more than 80 percent of the roughly 55,000 votes cast in the Arizona portion of the Navajo Nation \u2014 the country\u2019s largest tribe \u2014 and in the smaller Hopi Reservation, which shares precincts with the Navajo. Turnout and the Democratic vote share on the Navajo and Hopi reservations both increased this year, compared with 2016, and turnout rose slightly more on the reservations than it did statewide. Mr. Biden received about 13,500 more votes from the reservations than Hillary Clinton did four years ago. That alone could account for Mr. Biden\u2019s 10,500-vote margin of victory over President Trump in Arizona, even before looking at his strong support among other tribes there, like the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, which has been enraged by the president\u2019s efforts to build his border wall through tribal land. On average, Native voters lean left and have a history of swinging close elections to Democrats. Native Americans, including members of Sioux and Chippewa tribes and the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, are widely credited with helping to elect former Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, in 2012, and Blackfeet and Crow voters were integral in re-electing Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, in 2018. But like any group, Native Americans are politically diverse. In 2010, Native Alaskans helped re-elect Senator Lisa Murkowski as a write-in candidate after she lost the Republican primary. And come January, the six Indigenous members of Congress will be evenly split between the parties. The strong preference for Mr. Biden among Navajo voters was related in part to the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, which has devastated the Navajo Nation. But the high turnout was a product of organizing, which takes a lot of time and work in Native American communities that are affected by voter ID laws, far-flung polling places and poor infrastructure, and have centuries of reasons not to trust the United States government. \u201cNo one has ever taken the time to really reach out to the individuals themselves and say, \u2018These are the list of reasons why you need to register to vote and cast your ballot, because this is something that affects you,\u2019\u201d said Tara Benally, field director for the Rural Arizona Project and a Navajo citizen. \u201cBuilding that relationship with the people, it\u2019s what the federal government needs to do. They\u2019ve never actually done that with the Indigenous nations.\u201d The Rural Arizona Project, a nonprofit that mobilizes voters in rural areas, had seven to 10 field organizers this year and worked with 200 Indigenous artists and influencers to promote a voter registration tool designed for communities without traditional street addresses. Native Americans are often disenfranchised when clerks mistakenly register them in the wrong precinct, but the tool lets voters enter plus codes \u2014 essentially shortened coordinates \u2014 to identify their locations more precisely. Ms. Benally\u2019s team contacted thousands of Navajo and Hopi voters, held drive-through events to register voters safely during the pandemic, and ultimately registered more than 4,500, the group\u2019s executive director, TJ Ellerbeck, said. A separate effort by Four Directions \u2014 led by Mr. Semans\u2019s daughter, Donna Semans, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe \u2014 registered about 2,000 Navajo voters. VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan group focused on low-propensity voters, sent more than 400,000 texts, according to its chief of staff, Jordan James Harvill, a Cherokee and Choctaw citizen. Advocacy groups also reached out to postal workers, who agreed to drive mail-in ballots straight to their destination to avoid the circuitous route that mail from the Navajo Nation often takes. Native Americans were also influential in Wisconsin, where Mr. Biden won by about 20,000 votes. The state\u2019s most Democratic area, where Mr. Biden received 82 percent of the vote, was Menominee County, which is near Green Bay and is home to the Menominee Tribe. Ashland and Bayfield Counties, which have significant Native American populations, were blue spots in a sea of red in northern Wisconsin. Native turnout was substantial, and heavily Democratic, even in states where the race wasn\u2019t close, like North and South Dakota (which Mr. Trump won) and Minnesota (which Mr. Biden won). Four Directions registered more than 8,000 voters in Minnesota. In North Carolina, it was Mr. Trump who benefited: He improved on his 2016 margin in Robeson County, where members of the Lumbee Tribe are concentrated. Many Lumbee voters chose Barack Obama when he narrowly won the state in 2008. Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden both support federal recognition of the tribe, but Mr. Trump held a rally in Robeson County where he emphasized it. That, along with his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement, probably contributed to his success in the county, said Malinda Maynor Lowery, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who is Lumbee. Native Americans\u2019 electoral gains this year built on ones made in 2018, when voters elected the first two Native American women to Congress: Representatives Sharice Davids of Kansas, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, and Deb Haaland of New Mexico, a member of the Laguna Pueblo people. Ms. Haaland is a contender to be interior secretary, which could further energize voters. \u201cThose individuals are making a connection between us as members of our sovereign, Indigenous nations and us as citizens of the United States,\u201d Professor Lowery said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a tortured relationship, but to see people who are willing to manage it and who have persuaded a wide swath of voters to support them is deeply encouraging.\u201d Part of the progress stems from years of work to decrease legal and geographical barriers. Groups like the Native American Rights Fund and Four Directions have challenged numerous laws that disenfranchise Native Americans, like a voter ID law in North Dakota that required traditional street addresses until the state agreed to ensure voting access for tribes. The barriers still exist, but the advances have been strong enough to prompt groups to expand their focus to places like Georgia, where Native American populations are smaller and less recognized. \u201cI think that the fact that so many Native voters did turn out despite all of the obstacles is a really important moment of reckoning,\u201d said Katrina Phillips, an assistant professor of history at Macalester College and a member of the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point where the government can\u2019t necessarily forget about us anymore.\u201d Ms. McCormick, the chief of the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe in Georgia, said she hoped that politicians would take note if Native Americans voted in the runoffs in larger numbers, and that they would develop policies to help Native communities in return. That could mean reversing a Department of Housing and Urban Development rule that effectively restricts HUD funding to Georgia tribes; increasing education funding and access to health care; and recognizing tribes like Georgia\u2019s federally. Four Directions is already knocking on doors in Atlanta, where some of Georgia\u2019s Native Americans live, and tribal leaders will help identify members who live outside the tribes\u2019 main communities. Next week, the group will send a policy questionnaire to all four Senate candidates, in hopes that the responses will help voters make their decisions and hammer home how federal policy can affect their lives. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring Native issues to the incumbents and to the candidates,\u201d Mr. Semans said. \u201cWhether they want to hear it or not.\u201d",

    "article_text": "Georgia Was a Big Win for Democrats. Black Women Did the Groundwork. RIVERDALE, Ga. \u2014 Decades before Joseph R. Biden Jr. flipped Georgia for the Democrats, Felicia Davis was a one-stop political organizing dynamo in Clayton County, canvassing for issues rather than candidates, for her community rather than a political party. The boom of her voice and the clarity of her convictions command respect. In her operation, even the teenagers are paid $15 an hour to knock on doors and distribute literature. Almost everyone is diligent: She is not someone to disappoint. \u201cI am unapologetically Black,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cMy agenda is Black. My community is Black. My county is Black. So what I do is Black. And for 20 years, we\u2019ve been trying to tell people what was possible.\u201d When Georgia turned blue for Mr. Biden this year after record voter turnout, it validated the political vision and advocacy of a group of Black women who have led a decades-long organizing effort to transform the state\u2019s electorate. Democrats celebrated their work registering new voters, canvassing and engaging in long-term political outreach. The achievement seemed to confirm mantras that have become commonplace in liberal politics, like \u201ctrust Black women\u201d and \u201cBlack women are the backbone of the Democratic Party.\u201d But the same women tell a more complicated story about their relationship with elected Democrats, national campaign officials and prominent political groups. For years, they said, their political vision was demeaned and distrusted. Donors and campaigns balked at the idea that Georgia was a battleground state worth investing in and that the organizers had picked up on demographic and political changes in their home state that others had missed. Now, with Georgia at the center of the political universe ahead of two pivotal Senate runoff elections in January, the organizers are asking Democrats: Will you embrace our approach now? \u201cWe weren\u2019t surprised that Georgia turned blue, because we\u2019ve been working on it for over 15 years,\u201d said Deborah Scott, the founder of Georgia Stand Up. When she started the group in 2004, she said, it was hard to persuade philanthropy groups and political foundations that focus on grass-roots organizing to consider Georgia. \u201cIt\u2019s been an uphill battle,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cBecause here, we\u2019re not just women, we\u2019re Southern women. And we\u2019re not just Southern women, we\u2019re Southern Black women.\u201d The most famous member of the club is Stacey Abrams, the former state lawmaker and candidate for governor who founded a voter registration group called the New Georgia Project. But there are many others \u2014 like Ms. Davis and Helen Butler, who was mentored by the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, the late civil rights leader \u2014 who have spent years working to turn out voters in Georgia. No single group delivered the state to Mr. Biden or can take credit for turnout there. In a presidential race decided by a razor-thin margin in Georgia, every piece mattered: increased turnout among young voters; outreach to Black, Latino and Asian-American communities; and a rejection of President Trump by some college-educated white voters who typically vote Republican. In the organizers\u2019 telling, the story of how Georgia voted does not start with Mr. Trump\u2019s election in 2016 or Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign investment this year. It begins a decade earlier, when a new generation of Black female leaders decided to create their own structures, fed up with a state party dominated by conservative \u201cDixiecrats\u201d and a moderate establishment that presumed the electorate could not change. They would identify, engage and turn out communities that had been traditionally overlooked \u2014 just as they had been themselves. It was a slow build that included close losses in the 2016 presidential election, the 2017 House special election in Georgia and Ms. Abrams\u2019s run in 2018. Ms. Butler, the executive director of the Georgia Coalition for the People\u2019s Agenda, said her group\u2019s political work showed how \u201cBlack women take care of the entire community, not just themselves.\u201d Nse Ufot, who leads the New Georgia Project, said the same national leaders now praising voter registration efforts in Georgia should reflect on how long it had taken them and groups like the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to invest in the Black women leading the push. \u201cNational campaign committees and presidential campaigns, like the D.N.C. and the D.C.C.C., would have their favorite pastor or their favorite community activists just run programs,\u201d she said. \u201cNo accountability. No data.\u201d Ms. Ufot added: \u201cIt was just their favorite pastor dude saying, \u2018Turn your people out.\u2019 When people like Helen Butler could actually run a proper program.\u201d \u201cFoundations were not supporting social justice and community building work here,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one was looking at what\u2019s happening in our rural areas, and no one\u2019s looking at the small ways that people were being cheated out of their own democracy by having these voter suppression laws. People weren\u2019t even paying attention, because they thought that\u2019s just the way it was here.\u201d For years, national Democratic campaigns have wrestled with whether Georgia and other Southern states were worthy investments, including during former President Barack Obama\u2019s race in 2012 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016. However, in the zero-sum environment of presidential politics, Democrats prioritized other states, including in the Upper Midwest and traditional battlegrounds like Ohio and Florida.  Asked about the criticism from Ms. Ufot and others, representatives for the D.N.C. and the D.C.C.C. declined to respond directly. A spokeswoman for the D.C.C.C. praised the organizing in Georgia and said that in recent years, the party had invested in local groups and campaign organizers with success. \u201cGeorgia doesn\u2019t turn blue without the determined organizing of activists and leaders in communities of color, particularly the Black community,\u201d said Robyn Patterson, the national press secretary for the D.C.C.C. \u201cHouse Democrats flipped two Trump-lean districts by investing early, hiring talented organizers with deep ties to their communities, and engaging the people of color who have spent years working to move Georgia forward.\u201d The arc of Georgia\u2019s transformation has become a road map for other states that are experiencing rapid demographic change and a catalyst for a new strategy in liberal politics. Versions of the New Georgia Project have popped up in Virginia, Texas and North Carolina as organizers try to create new, consistent voting blocs. This year, the progressive donor Susan Sandler gave $200 million to fund such efforts in the South and Southwest. An accompanying note said she had become convinced that investing in these groups \u2014 and not in campaigns \u2014 was the path to building long-term power among minority communities. Democratic groups and candidates have changed as well, with organizations like the D.C.C.C. garnering praise from Georgia Democrats this cycle for investing earlier in the state. Black Democrats running statewide campaigns in the South have reflected the message of Ms. Abrams, who embraced the racial and gender diversity of the party\u2019s base. The fact that the winning presidential ticket included a Black woman was another sign that the Democratic Party had come to recognize the most consistent part of its voting and organizing base, said Melanie Campbell, who convenes a group called the Black Women\u2019s Roundtable and is president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris\u2019s nomination \u201cwas that moment \u2014 for so many sisters \u2014 it was about more than just a ticket,\u201d Ms. Campbell said. \u201cIt was about having arrived to a place of being fully seen and fully respected as Black women.\u201d In a recent phone interview, Ms. Abrams, who is expected to run again for governor, recalled how she had driven to 150 of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties before her 2018 bid, learning about places where local leaders said the party could be more viable. \u201cBut when I got into those places, there was always someone there to meet me \u2014 who had been waiting for someone to come to help connect and help them build this network,\u201d she said. \u201cSo whether it was finding Black voters in South Georgia, and working with Black immigrants in Gwinnett, or working with the A.A.P.I. community, or going to North Georgia and meeting with more and more Latino voters.\u201d (A.A.P.I. refers to Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.) Ms. Abrams also said she disliked \u201ctrust Black women\u201d as a motto because it didn\u2019t reflect the diverse coalition that had brought change to the state. A New York Times analysis of Georgia voters found that turnout had increased among minority communities and in the diverse suburbs but that the biggest shift to Democrats was among white college graduates and wealthier residents. \u201cI appreciate the necessity of that battle cry,\u201d Ms. Abrams said. \u201cAnd in my approach, in Georgia in particular, Black women have been instrumental. But I chafe at this idea that we then objectify one group as both savior and as responsible party.\u201d Still, it was Black women who laid the organizing framework in Georgia, and who are doing so again ahead of the Senate runoffs. Ms. Ufot\u2019s group held a small celebration on the Saturday after Election Day, after Mr. Biden crossed the threshold of 270 electoral votes, but was back to organizing by that Monday. In Clayton County, south of Atlanta, Ms. Davis\u2019s small army of canvassers is encouraging residents to participate in the runoffs but is also focusing on a down-ballot race for the state\u2019s public service commission. Many voter registration efforts in Georgia are run by nonprofit, apolitical organizations, including the People\u2019s Agenda, Georgia Stand Up and the New Georgia Project, that target historically disadvantaged communities and nonwhite voters. Because those demographic groups tend to break for Democrats, and given that leaders like Ms. Butler and Ms. Ufot have professional and personal histories with people like Ms. Abrams, Republicans have sometimes cast the groups as unofficial wings of the Democratic Party \u2014 which has placed them under intense legal and journalistic scrutiny. The women who lead these groups say they take pride in their legal and operational independence and denounce the transactional nature of political campaigns and candidates. Their message, they say, is about turning passive constituents of a democratic society into active participants. It is an enduring effort that begins before the flood of candidate ads and party literature and continues long after. Ms. Butler, the head of the People\u2019s Agenda, said what had given her the most pride this year was not the Democratic success in Georgia, but the high turnout and continued ascendance of nonwhite voters. \u201cThe more people that get engaged in this, the more diverse opinions we have, I think we come out with better elected officials,\u201d she said. But those who are explicit about their partisan leanings said a blue Georgia was vindication after years of what-ifs and close calls. The next time they ask for investment and trust, it will be easier, they said. And for Black women everywhere, there is now a model for expanding their political power. \u201cWe are the home of Scarlett O\u2019Hara and \u2018Gone With the Wind,\u2019\u201d Ms. Davis said, referring to the 1936 plantation epic that was set in Clayton County. \u201cSo you have to think about it like that. What we\u2019re doing here is putting to rest some of the worst aspects of old Southern culture. And that\u2019s a powerful thing.\u201d",

    "article_text": "A lawsuit in Georgia claims that nearly 200,000 registered voters were improperly purged. Voter advocacy groups in Georgia filed a lawsuit on Wednesday asking a federal court to compel the state to restore nearly 200,000 names to its voter registration list ahead of the January runoff races for the state\u2019s two Senate seats that will determine the balance of power in Washington.  In the suit, filed in the northern district of Georgia, three voter advocacy groups said the state had improperly removed 198,000 people from its voter registration lists in 2019 on the grounds that they had changed their addresses.  The Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union released a report in September based on an investigation by a progressive independent journalist, Greg Palast, who found that most of the approximately 300,000 people removed had not changed their addresses. Since the investigation was completed, several thousand voters have died or moved, but more than 195,000 remained wrongly affected, the suit says. The Georgia A.C.L.U. said in a statement that those removed from the rolls were likely to be \u201cyoung voters, voters of lower income, and citizens of racial groups that have been denied their sacred right to vote in the past.\u201d The suit comes after a pair of hard-fought Senate races in which neither leading candidate received 50 percent of the vote, sending both contests to runoffs that will be held Jan. 5. One race pits the Republican senator David Perdue against the Democrat Jon Ossoff. In the other, Senator Kelly Loeffler, also a Republican, will face a Democratic challenge from the Rev. Raphael Warnock. If Democrats win both races, they will effectively control the Senate. The office of the Georgia secretary of state, led by Brad Raffensperger, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But during a separate news conference on Wednesday, Gabriel Sterling, Georgia\u2019s voting system implementation manager, dismissed the allegations.  \u201cI\u2019m going to go with no,\u201d he said, when asked whether his office had purged nearly 200,000 voters from registration lists. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019ve not seen or heard of this lawsuit yet.\u201d Since the election, Mr. Raffensperger\u2019s office has been dogged by baseless allegations of voter fraud from the Trump campaign. Mr. Raffensperger has repeatedly said that the results of the Georgia election were trustworthy. LaTosha Brown, the head of Black Voters Matter Fund, one of the plaintiffs in the suit, said the issue with the election was not voter fraud.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a voter suppression,\u201d she said during a news conference on Wednesday with members of the other advocacy groups. \u201cMassive scale voter suppression.\u201d",

    "article_text": "2,596 Trades in One Term: Inside Senator Perdue\u2019s Stock Portfolio As a member of the Senate\u2019s cybersecurity subcommittee, David Perdue has raised alarms that hackers from overseas pose a threat to U.S. computer networks. Citing a frightening report by a California-based company called FireEye, Mr. Perdue was among the senators who asked this spring that the National Guard prepare to protect against such data breaches. Not only was the issue important to Mr. Perdue, so was FireEye, a federal contractor that provides malware detection and threat-intelligence services. Beginning in 2016, the senator bought and sold FireEye stock 61 times, at one point owning as much as $250,000 worth of shares in the company. Along with Senator Kelly Loeffler, a fellow Georgia Republican, Mr. Perdue faces an unusual runoff election in January. With control of the Senate at stake, and amid renewed concern about the potential for conflicts of interest in stock trading by members of Congress, Mr. Perdue\u2019s investment activity \u2014 and especially his numerous well-timed trades \u2014 has increasingly come into the public glare. Last week, The New York Times reported that the Justice Department had investigated the senator for possible insider trading in his sale of more than $1 million worth of stock in a financial-analysis firm, Cardlytics. Ultimately, prosecutors declined to bring charges. Other media outlets have revealed several trades in companies whose business dealings fall under the jurisdiction of Mr. Perdue\u2019s committees. An examination of Mr. Perdue\u2019s stock trading during his six years in office reveals that he has been the Senate\u2019s most prolific stock trader by far, sometimes reporting 20 or more transactions in a single day. The Times analyzed data compiled by Senate Stock Watcher, a nonpartisan website that aggregates publicly available information on lawmakers\u2019 trading, and found that Mr. Perdue\u2019s transactions accounted for nearly a third of all senators\u2019 trades reported in the past six years. His 2,596 trades, mostly in stocks but also in bonds and funds, roughly equal the combined trading volume of the next five most active traders in the Senate. The data also shows the breadth of trades Mr. Perdue made in companies that stood to benefit from policy and spending matters that came not just before the Senate as a whole, but before the committees and subcommittees on which he served. Nearly half of Mr. Perdue\u2019s FireEye trades, for example, occurred while he sat on the cybersecurity panel, a role that potentially could have provided him with nonpublic information about companies like FireEye. During that period, FireEye landed a subcontract worth more than $30 million with the Army Cyber Command, which had operations at Fort Gordon, in Mr. Perdue\u2019s home state. In 2018, Mr. Perdue reported capital gains of up to $15,000 from FireEye trades. And as a member of the Senate banking, housing, and urban affairs committee since 2017, Mr. Perdue bought and sold shares of a number of financial companies his panel oversaw, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Regions Financial. Mr. Perdue disputes the notion that his investment activity posed a conflict, saying that his trades were handled by outside advisers without his input, although his instructions to Goldman Sachs to sell Cardlytics suggest that he directed at least some trades. \u201cSenator Perdue doesn\u2019t handle the day-to-day decisions of his portfolio \u2014 all of his holdings are managed by outside financial advisers who make recommendations, set strategy, and manage trades and personal finances,\u201d said John Burke, the communications director for the senator\u2019s re-election campaign. Robert Hutchinson, Mr. Perdue\u2019s wealth manager at Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. In April, after questions were raised about stock trades that Mr. Perdue and other senators had made around the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, he abruptly sold virtually all of his stock holdings \u2014 between $3.2 million and $9.4 million worth. (Members of Congress report their transactions in ranges, so it is often impossible to pinpoint the exact dollar values.) In May, he announced that his advisers would no longer trade in individual stocks for his portfolio, with the exception of a few companies on whose boards he had previously served, including Cardlytics; the utility Alliant Energy; and Graphic Packaging, a paper-based-packaging provider. Though Mr. Perdue has been unusually active in stock trading, his robust investing activity highlights broader questions once again being debated, more than eight years after the passage of the STOCK Act, a law meant to grapple with the ethical issues inherent in lawmakers\u2019 buying and selling stocks. While there is no law or regulation prohibiting such trading, the practice has long invited questions about possible conflicts \u2014 and the potential for insider trading \u2014 that can arise when members of powerful congressional committees buy and sell shares of companies directly affected by the issues before them. (By comparison, avoiding some or all individual stocks is common practice in other branches of government, where federal law prohibits most employees from engaging in matters whose outcomes may have financial implications for them.) \u201cMembers are in a constant state of gathering information from briefings, hearings, constituent meetings, investigations and staff,\u201d said Aaron Cooper, special counsel to the law firm Jenner & Block who previously served as lead minority investigative counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee. \u201cThey receive a massive amount of data every day \u2014 both public and nonpublic \u2014 and it\u2019s not always clear which category the information belongs to.\u201d As a result, he said, \u201cprosecutors often face an uphill battle\u201d in making an insider-trading case against a member of Congress. The trend on Capitol Hill was already moving away from individual stock holding when Mr. Perdue was elected in 2014. Many senators had reduced their trading in individual stocks after the 2012 STOCK Act, which prohibited members of Congress from trading on nonpublic information acquired in the course of their duties. An analysis by Public Citizen published in 2017 credited the legislation with a 50 percent decline in stock trading by senators. Mr. Perdue\u2019s Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, has seized on the trading as a campaign issue. In a news conference on Monday, he accused Mr. Perdue of \u201cusing his office to enrich himself\u201d through the stock trades. A spokesman for Mr. Perdue called the critique a \u201cdiscredited line of attack\u201d that was \u201cbaseless,\u201d and his campaign recently unveiled an ad arguing that he was \u201ctotally exonerated\u201d by federal overseers who had studied his trades. Yet others have also found fault with Mr. Perdue\u2019s trading. In a letter last week to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, requested an investigation of Mr. Perdue\u2019s trades in BWX Technologies, a Virginia-based company that supplies nuclear components for Navy submarines. The trades were first reported by The Daily Beast. Mr. Perdue began buying the company\u2019s stock about a month before he took over as chairman of the Senate\u2019s seapower subcommittee, where he pushed to beef up the nation\u2019s defenses, including by adding a multibillion-dollar nuclear submarine of the type BWX Technologies provides components for. He reported earning between $15,000 and $50,000 in capital gains when he sold the stock. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who believes that the STOCK Act does not go far enough, has co-sponsored legislation that would ban the trading of individual stocks by members of Congress. \u201cThere is no way that the public can\u2019t sense, can\u2019t absolutely smell, that this is corrupt, that you have it in the back of your mind when you vote,\u201d said Mr. Merkley, a Democrat. \u201cYou may have the public interest in your mind, but you also have in your mind how that decision might impact the value of your portfolio.\u201d Mr. Perdue, whose estimated net worth is more than $15 million, arrived on Capitol Hill in 2015, billing himself as an outsider and emphasizing his experience as a top executive at companies like Dollar General, Reebok and Haggar Clothing. He immediately established himself as a skeptic of government regulation, at various points suggesting the abolishment of both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. As his term progressed, Mr. Perdue \u2014 or his advisers \u2014 would place some prescient bets in his portfolio, buying and selling stocks at just the right moment. His trading in Devon Energy, a company co-founded in 1971 by J. Larry Nichols, a major Republican donor, provides an example. On Nov. 12, 2015, Mr. Perdue sold his position in Devon, worth between $50,000 and $100,000, on a day the stock\u2019s price closed at $45.06. Over the next month, Devon\u2019s price would fall as low as $31.54, a 30 percent drop from the date Mr. Perdue liquidated his holdings. Analysts attributed the stock\u2019s decline to the company\u2019s announcement, after Mr. Perdue\u2019s sale, that it would acquire assets from Felix Energy. Though Mr. Perdue has traded many energy stocks while in office, buying and selling dozens of drilling, pipeline, power, and related equipment companies, the transactions that invite special scrutiny are those involving industries that were within his direct oversight through his committee positions. Mr. Perdue actively traded in First Data, a financial firm based in Atlanta. Like his trading in Devon Energy, Mr. Perdue\u2019s transactions in First Data appear to have been well timed, as reported by The Daily Beast. After selling his entire stake in First Data in November 2018, Mr. Perdue repurchased shares in the company that December, three weeks before it announced a merger with the financial services technology firm Fiserv on Jan. 16, 2019. Mr. Perdue subsequently reported capital gains of $50,000 to $100,000 in First Data. Mr. Perdue had received campaign contributions from First Data executives. During his Senate term, Mr. Perdue has at various times held shares in roughly a dozen banks, ranging in size from JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank with nearly $2.7 trillion in assets, to the comparatively tiny First Hawaiian Bank. Regions Financial, a regional lender based in Birmingham, Ala., has been one of Mr. Perdue\u2019s frequent trades. He spent much of his term loading up on the stock, buying shares on 30 occasions. Mr. Perdue was particularly active in buying Regions in 2017 and early 2018. During that time, he was also pushing to roll back financial regulations that had imposed additional scrutiny and cash constraints on banks with more than $50 billion in assets after the financial crisis. On Sept. 28, 2017, he co-sponsored a Senate bill proposing to soften the regulations governing midsize banks like Regions. A broader bill, which included the same proposal, was approved by the Senate the following March and signed into law by President Trump that May. Between May 2017, about four months before Mr. Perdue introduced his legislation, and that November, he made more than a dozen purchases of Regions shares. And between Mr. Perdue\u2019s first purchase of Regions stock in 2017 and the time Mr. Trump signed the bill in 2018, the bank\u2019s shares rallied 35 percent. The chief executive of Regions, John M. Turner Jr., has also contributed to Mr. Perdue\u2019s re-election campaign. Mr. Perdue\u2019s decision to sell off his stock holdings this past April followed criticism of trades made by several senators in coronavirus-sensitive stocks just after they had attended a Senate briefing on Jan. 24. In the aftermath of those sales, the Justice Department opened investigations into trading by Ms. Loeffler; Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina; his Republican colleague James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma; and Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat. All have since been closed except the Burr inquiry, which is also nearing an end, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Perdue, whose office has said he did not attend that briefing, was among those who bought and sold some of those stocks, including Pfizer, in the weeks that followed. Mr. Perdue purchased up to $260,000 worth of Pfizer stock between Feb. 26 and Feb. 28, in the early days of a market downturn. On the 28th, he issued a news release reporting that he had regularly attended briefings led by the coronavirus task force; records subsequently showed that he had bought the third tranche of Pfizer shares that same day. The news release also emphasized that the U.S. government was expediting the development of a coronavirus vaccine. And in March, Pfizer announced its partnership with a German biotechnology company, BioNTech, to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Mr. Perdue had frequently traded Pfizer stock before this year. He had rarely traded another stock he bought in the early stages of the U.S. outbreak, DuPont, which, as a manufacturer of personal protective equipment, also stood to benefit from the coronavirus response. (Mr. Perdue purchased some shares in DuPont on Jan. 24, the day of the Senate briefing, and additional shares later.) In late February and early March, Mr. Perdue sold stock in Caesars, an entertainment company whose casino business would be hard-hit by the pandemic, but purchased shares of Disney and Delta, additions to his portfolio that seem to run counter to any suggestion that he was trading on insider information about the virus. Midway through April, Mr. Perdue began selling most of his stocks. He moved some of his money into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which track baskets of stocks or bonds. The shift appeared timed to counteract harsh criticism leveled by the senator\u2019s political opponents. But given that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a sharply divided Senate are unlikely to favor the energy and financial stocks in which Mr. Perdue was once so active, it may also have been a prescient financial move. Susan C.

Last month, a group of romance novelists launched \u201cRomancing the Runoff\u201d to mobilize Democratic voters in Georgia. The fund-raising effort was started by four romance novelists \u2014 Courtney Milan, Alyssa Cole, and Donna Herren and Bree Bridges, who write together under the pen name Kit Rocha. Their initial goal was to raise $20,000 for the New Georgia Project and Fair Fight, two voting rights organizations founded by Ms. Abrams, and for Black Voters Matter, a fund created to boost Black voter turnout. They blew past their goal and have raised more than $460,000. Ms. Milan said the project grew out of a text exchange between her and Ms. Bridges after it became clear that there would be a Senate runoff in Georgia. They were inspired by Ms. Abrams\u2019s efforts to flip Georgia for Democrats even after she lost her own campaign for governor, a show of optimism that Ms. Milan said typified romance readers\u2019 belief in \u201chappily ever after\u201d endings. \u201cA big part of it is because Stacey Abrams was so instrumental in establishing Fair Fight,\u201d Ms. Milan said. \u201cSomeone who sees that possibility for hope, and works to make it come to pass, is a quintessentially romance thing. You could just drown in pessimism, but she didn\u2019t.\u201d To rally romance readers, the organizers auctioned off more than 3,000 items, including a yearlong writing mentorship with the author Ann Aguirre (sold for $5,700); autographed and annotated copies of novels by the romance writer Tessa Dare; and a TV writing consultation with Sheryl J. Anderson, the showrunner for the Netflix series \u201cSweet Magnolias.\u201d One of the prized items: a signed hardback edition of Ms. Abrams\u2019s debut novel, \u201cRules of Engagement,\u201d which she wrote while attending Yale Law School. \u201cBoth Selena & Stacey will sign,\u201d Ms. Abrams wrote in a tweet endorsing the fund-raising effort, adding a winking emoji. The book sold for $3,200.",

    "article_text": "\u2018It Has to Stop\u2019: Georgia Election Official Lashes Trump ATLANTA \u2014 In one of the most striking rebukes to President Trump since he launched his baseless attacks on the American electoral process, a top-ranking Georgia election official lashed out at the president on Tuesday for failing to condemn threats of violence against people overseeing the voting system in his state. \u201cIt has to stop,\u201d Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and Georgia\u2019s voting system implementation manager, said at an afternoon news conference at the state Capitol, his voice shaking with emotion. \u201cMr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is elections. This is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It\u2019s too much.\u201d Mr. Sterling\u2019s outburst of anger and frustration came amid a sustained assault on Georgia\u2019s election process by Mr. Trump as he seeks to reverse his loss to his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Sterling, who previously said he had received threats himself, said that threats had also been made against the wife of his superior, Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state. \u201cMr. President, it looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia,\u201d Mr. Sterling said. He added that the president needed to \u201cstep up\u201d and say, \u201cStop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone is going to get hurt, someone is going to get shot, someone is going to get killed. And it\u2019s not right.\u201d Mr. Sterling also called on the state\u2019s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, to condemn the rhetoric that he said was getting dangerously out of hand. The two senators, both Trump loyalists, have called for Mr. Raffensperger to resign. As Mr. Trump hurls false claims of fraud in Georgia, a number of lawsuits filed by conservatives in state and federal courts are seeking to decertify the results. The second of two recounts requested by the Trump campaign is in progress and is expected to wind up Wednesday. And the Georgia Republican Party has descended into a state of virtual civil war as some of its most powerful players maneuver and malign their rivals, seeking advantage, or at least survival. In the meantime, Mr. Trump continues to lash out at Gov. Brian Kemp and Mr. Raffensperger, both staunch Republicans and Trump supporters, over the fact that he lost Georgia, saying they have not sufficiently rooted out fraud. As late as Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump made the latest in a series of unsubstantiated claims about the Georgia election, writing on Twitter that the state had been \u201cscammed\u201d and urging Mr. Kemp to \u201ccall off\" the election. Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have taken to the streets and the Capitol building in downtown Atlanta, where the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of Infowars recently joined them. In other cases, Trump supporters have harassed or threatened Mr. Sterling, Mr. Raffensperger and others. In a statement Tuesday evening, Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said: \u201cThe campaign is focused on ensuring that all legal votes are counted and all illegal votes are not. No one should engage in threats or violence, and if that has happened, we condemn that fully.\u201d Amid all of this, Mr. Sterling, a detail-oriented former city councilman from the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs, has taken on a prominent role in the state as it conducted its recounts. Along with Mr. Raffensperger, he has often been the main speaker in numerous news conferences in which he has explained the complexities of Georgia\u2019s election and recount systems and has argued that the results, which currently show Mr. Biden winning by about 12,700 votes, are trustworthy. Ari Schaffer, press secretary for the secretary of state\u2019s office, did not answer directly when asked Tuesday whether Mr. Raffensperger had given Mr. Sterling his blessing to speak out so forcefully against the president. But he noted that the deputy secretary of state, Jordan Fuchs, had been standing near Mr. Sterling when he made his statements. \u201cGabriel has my support,\u201d Ms. Fuchs said independently in a text message. Late Tuesday, representatives for Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue said they condemned violence of any kind but also said they would not apologize for seeking accountability and accuracy in the state\u2019s elections.  In the second of two news conferences called by the secretary of state\u2019s office on Tuesday, Mr. Sterling, speaking loudly, emotionally and deliberately, said that people had intruded on Mr. Raffensperger\u2019s personal property. He said that Mr. Raffensperger\u2019s wife \u201cis getting sexualized threats through her cellphone.\u201d He mentioned that he had police protection outside his own house, a topic he had also broached in a Nov. 21 tweet. \u201cSo this is fun \u2026 multiple attempted hacks of my emails, police protection around my home, the threats,\u201d Mr. Sterling wrote then. \u201cBut all is well \u2026 following the law, following the process \u2026 doing our jobs.\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Sterling also made references to reports that Joe diGenova, a lawyer for the Trump campaign, had said that Chris Krebs \u2014 a former federal cybersecurity official who vouched that the election was clean \u2014 should be shot. (Mr. diGenova later said his remarks had been \u201cmade in jest.\u201d) But Mr. Sterling said that \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d had involved a threat against a 20-year-old contractor for a voting system company in Gwinnett County. He said the young worker had been targeted by someone who hung a noose and declared that the worker should be \u201chung for treason,\u201d simply for doing a routine element of his job. Mr. Sterling did not provide any other details. \u201cI can\u2019t begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every American, every Georgian, Republican and Democrat alike, should have that same level of anger.\u201d Details of the noose incident Mr. Sterling cited could not be corroborated Tuesday. Cpl. Ryan Winderweedle, a spokesman for the Gwinnett County Police Department, said that he did not have any information about such an incident but noted that it could have occurred beyond that department\u2019s jurisdiction. Joe Sorenson, a spokesman for the county government, said in an email that \u201ccitizen monitors\u201d had \u201charassed\u201d some county technology workers who were doing work that was unrelated to the elections but that involved going in and out of a storage area in the same building as the county elections office.

    "article_text": "\u2018Georgia Is Not New York\u2019: Progressives Adapt Efforts for Senate Runoffs Neither Jon Ossoff nor the Rev. Raphael Warnock has endorsed the Green New Deal. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the Sunrise Movement, the activist climate group that champions the sweeping climate change plan, from mobilizing in force for the two Georgia Democrats in their high-stakes runoff races for Senate seats. The group is aiming to help register 10,000 to 20,000 Georgians who will turn 18 by Jan. 5, the day of the elections. It has people on the ground canvassing and dropping off campaign literature. And while its appeals mention the threat from climate change, it does not present the issue as a litmus test. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re focused on the bigger picture,\u201d said Shant\u00e9 Wolfe, who is leading the Sunrise Movement\u2019s work in Georgia. \u201cOur effort is in favor of the greater good.\u201d The furious efforts in Georgia by the Sunrise Movement and other progressive groups \u2014 on behalf of two candidates who do not share their most ambitious policy goals \u2014 reflect the urgency that is consuming the Democratic Party\u2019s left flank. Two victories in Georgia would produce a 50-50 tie in the Senate, giving Democrats control of the chamber because Kamala Harris would cast tiebreaking votes as vice president. Without Democratic control, progressive lawmakers, activists and their grass-roots supporters worry that they will not be able to achieve even a pared-down version of their policy wish list for the country. But they also understand that for decades Georgia has been a Republican stronghold with a large number of conservative voters, and that their efforts there need to be modulated. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the state, many Democrats point out, with a moderate agenda that tempered the rhetoric and policy goals of the left. Mr. Biden, Mr. Warnock and Mr. Ossoff do not support \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d another priority of the party\u2019s left wing. Ms. Wolfe said the Sunrise Movement had tried to adjust its messaging for a state like Georgia by \u201cmaking sure that we localize the Green New Deal in a way that resonates with Southerners.\u201d For instance, canvassers are emphasizing how climate change affects the air that Georgians breathe, she said. Other groups are also pouring money and resources into the state. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee has already raised $386,000 for the two Democratic candidates. MoveOn, a progressive group, hopes to mobilize many of its 250,000 members in Georgia, and more nationwide, to canvass and phone bank in the state. Our Revolution, the political organization that spun out of Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, is currently contacting its 50,000 member households in the state to encourage them to request mail ballots. \u201cWe are moving heaven and earth and pointing all of our resources as much as we can to help us win those two seats in Georgia,\u201d said Jamaal Bowman, a New York Democrat who will be sworn into the next Congress. Mr. Bowman said he spoke recently with Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the Georgia governor\u2019s race in 2018 and is widely credited with voter turnout initiatives that helped flip Georgia blue this year, to see how he could support her efforts. And he said that he and other progressives in the House \u2014 including \u201cthe Squad,\u201d a now-growing group that began with four congresswomen of color \u2014 were strategizing about how to help in Georgia. \u201cGeorgia is not New York. It\u2019s not California. It has its own culture,\u201d Mr. Bowman said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a culture rooted in justice for all, and we just want to make sure we support that initiative as much as we can, as representatives from other parts of the country.\u201d Amid deepening ideological fault lines among Democrats over messaging and electoral strategy \u2014 divisions that have burst into the open as the party takes stock of its painful losses down the ballot \u2014 the two Senate runoff elections will also be a test case for whether progressives can balance their broad calls for change with the realities of campaigning in a once reliably Republican state.  Defeating two Republican incumbents, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, will be no easy task for Mr. Ossoff and Mr. Warnock. Still, the competitiveness of the races, and the progressive focus on Georgia, underscores the political evolution occurring in the state. Mr. Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. And though Georgia does not have a reputation now as a hotbed of liberalism, some organizers and strategists inside and outside Georgia contend that it is becoming increasingly receptive to left-leaning ideas. While many of the Democrats who won in Georgia last month were more moderate, including Carolyn Bourdeaux, who flipped a longtime Republican House district in metropolitan Atlanta, several local progressive candidates won farther down the ballot. They include Nicole Love Hendrickson, who became the first Black person elected as commission chairwoman of Gwinnett County, in suburban Atlanta. Progressives see Georgia not as a one-off endeavor in 2020 but as a top target of their efforts for years to come. \u201cIs Georgia a Tier 1 state? Is Georgia a progressive state? Are we building a new Georgia? Yes, yes and yes,\u201d said Britney Whaley, a political strategist with the Working Families Party, a progressive group that has been operating in Georgia since 2018 and has endorsed Mr. Warnock. Nse Ufot, the chief executive of the New Georgia Project, which was founded by Ms. Abrams and has registered hundreds of thousands of new voters, said there was still \u201can obsession with moving white moderate men back into the Democratic Party.\u201d But that thinking was mistaken, she said, even \u2014 and perhaps especially \u2014 in Georgia. \u201cIt just feels like people do not get, and do not understand, what it takes to win and what it takes to win in the South,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can contribute to this progressive majority \u2014 it\u2019s just that it can\u2019t be race-blind. It can\u2019t be race neutral.\u201d There are plenty of signs that suggest liberals still face an uphill battle in Georgia. Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and progressive standard-bearer, lost Georgia\u2019s Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton by more than 40 percentage points in 2016. (Mr. Sanders had dropped out of the race by the time Georgia held its primary in June this year.) Mr. Biden beat President Trump in Georgia by making significant gains among affluent, college-educated and older voters in the suburbs around Atlanta, according to a New York Times Upshot analysis of the results; at the same time, the Black share of the electorate fell to its lowest point since 2006. Those findings indicate that Democrats must still depend on the support of traditionally conservative voters to win statewide \u2014 rather than turning out a progressive majority led by young voters and nonwhite voters. Even if the Democrats win the two Georgia Senate seats, progressives will still face significant barriers to passing their policies. It is unlikely that all 50 Democratic senators would get behind a left-wing policy proposal like expanding the Supreme Court, or that Mr. Biden would support it. Representative Ro Khanna of California, the first vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said the Georgia races were \u201cabout the here and now.\u201d \u201cWe understand the stakes, and every progressive group that I know of has made that a priority with the same passion and determination as winning back the presidency,\u201d he said. But he also said the horizon for the movement was long. Even if Democrats fail to win control of the Senate, he said, progressives should try to pass an agenda in the House that includes less transformative policy goals than Medicare for all \u2014 including raising the minimum wage, forgiving student loan debt and expanding access to Medicare. \u201cI don\u2019t think that their outcome should determine the boldness of our agenda,\u201d Mr. Khanna said, referring to the Georgia runoffs. \u201cThe mistake would be to pull back.\u201d For the party\u2019s left wing, the potential limits on a progressive agenda have not dampened the resolve. In a fund-raising email last month, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts hailed Mr. Biden\u2019s success as proof that \u201cthe path to victory in Georgia is clearer than ever.\u201d Then she issued a call to arms: \u201cDemocrats can win these two Senate races too \u2014 and we must.\u201d",

    "article_text": "No, Georgia\u2019s governor cannot \u2018overrule\u2019 its secretary of state on voting. President Trump on Monday morning inaccurately described Georgia\u2019s vote counting process and implausibly urged the state\u2019s Republican governor to \u201coverrule\u201d its Republican secretary of state. Why won\u2019t Governor @BrianKempGA, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes. It will be a \u201cgoldmine\u201d of fraud, and we will easily WIN the state.... The tweet was the latest of Mr. Trump\u2019s continuing assault on election results in Georgia and its top Republican officials, which has ignited an intraparty feud in the state. Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia does not have the authority to do what Mr. Trump is suggesting. Moreover, signature verification is already part of the vote counting process. When absentee ballots are received, Georgia\u2019s election officials verify the signature on the envelopes. The ballots and envelopes are then separated to protect privacy, so rechecking the envelopes during a recount would be meaningless. \u201cGeorgia law prohibits the governor from interfering in elections. The secretary of state, who is an elected constitutional officer, has oversight over elections that cannot be overridden by executive order,\u201d a spokesman for Mr. Kemp told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The notion that \u201cthe governor has inherent executive authority to suspend or investigate or somehow interfere with this process \u2014 that\u2019s just not true,\u201d said Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University. \u201cThere is no plausible case here whatsoever.\u201d Unlike the federal government, Georgia does not have a unitary executive and its governor and secretary of state have separate duties. Even the governor\u2019s emergency powers are limited. Mr. Kreis said that Georgia\u2019s code was \u201cvery clear\u201d on the kinds of things a governor can do in a state of emergency. Mr. Kemp can move resources and funds and enact temporary measures, Mr. Kreis said, but \u201che does not have the authority to expressly interfere with elections.\u201d Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, continued to push back on Mr. Trump\u2019s and his allies\u2019 baseless claims of mass voter fraud in a news conference on Monday. \u201cThe truth matters, especially around election administration,\u201d Mr. Raffensperger said. \u201cThere are those who exploit the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation and frankly, they\u2019re misleading the president as well, apparently.\u201d",

In a livestreamed discussion, they delved into ambitious ideas for conquering intractable problems \u2014 limited access to health care, inequality in the criminal justice system and attacks on voting rights. Politics has consumed much of Georgia in recent weeks. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the state \u2014 a feat no Democrat had managed in nearly three decades, and one confirmed by a hand audit of ballots \u2014 and two high-stakes runoffs in January will determine which party controls the Senate. Well, this is the other runoff, one mostly notable for the short turn the winner will have in Congress. Very short. All told, not even a month in the House. A peculiar set of circumstances has created a contest with stakes that could not be much lower. Mr. Hall and Dr. Franklin, both Democrats, are competing in a runoff on Tuesday in a reliably Democratic district for a term that ends at noon on Jan. 3. And there is no chance of an extension for the winner, as his successor was elected this month. Still, the candidates have argued that their bids are anything but inconsequential. The victor will serve what would have been the final days of John Lewis\u2019s 17th term representing Georgia\u2019s Fifth Congressional District. Mr. Lewis, the pioneering civil rights leader, died on July 17. \u201cThese are the days he earned,\u201d Dr. Franklin, a scholar of theology and former president of Morehouse College, said outside a library before he cast his ballot. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s the honor and the privilege.\u201d Dr. Franklin and Mr. Hall, a former Atlanta city councilman, advanced to a runoff after a special election in September, emerging from a mixed-party pack that included five Democrats, one independent and a Libertarian. \u201cIt matters to me,\u201d Mr. Hall said, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve had no representation since July 17.\u201d The district, which encompasses parts of Atlanta and its surrounding suburbs, is an economic and cultural hub that has long drawn African-Americans from across the South with possibilities for upward mobility and relief from the burdens of racial hostility in the places they left behind. But it is also an area that has been reminded of the ways that the aspirations for Atlanta\u2019s promise have fallen short of reality. Gentrification has spread rapidly, shoving out longtime Black residents. And in June, Rayshard Brooks, an African-American man, was killed by a city police officer, setting off protests that grew tense and violent and underscored that, despite its reputation, Atlanta was anything but immune to the pernicious and enduring consequences of racial inequality. After Mr. Lewis\u2019s death, Democratic Party officials had to rush to meet a state deadline to replace his name on the November ballot, putting out a call for applications and landing on Nikema Williams, a state senator. Party officials effectively handed Ms. Williams a ticket to Congress. Mr. Lewis, a Democrat, had won all but one of his re-election bids with more than 70 percent of the vote. Ms. Williams won with 85 percent of the vote, and she has already been elected as president of the incoming freshman class of Democrats. Mr. Hall and Dr. Franklin are involved in a separate process that began when Gov. Brian Kemp called for a special election to serve the remainder of Mr. Lewis\u2019s term. Ms. Williams declined to participate, and no candidate cleared the 50 percent hurdle in the September election, forcing the runoff. (Just over 31,000 people cast ballots.) The campaign might seem like a puzzling endeavor. Just the span between the special election and the runoff on Tuesday is more than twice as long as the amount of time the victor will have in Congress. Even so, the candidates have made serious investments of time and money. They have gathered endorsements from elected officials, activists and local business leaders. While donations are nowhere near the prodigious sums the heated Senate races have brought in, they have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars between them. Dr. Franklin hired a staff of eight and has kept a steady schedule of virtual events, like joining a gathering of interfaith leaders. Mr. Hall has run a leaner operation. He is his own communications director. The phone number posted on his campaign\u2019s Facebook page rings on his cellphone. He keeps his face covered and has swapped handshakes for elbow bumps during the pandemic, but he still prefers pounding the pavement. \u201cI\u2019m running for Congress,\u201d he told one person after another as he handed out fliers at a shopping center. Both men have lofty notions about what they could accomplish in office. Dr. Franklin sees a bully pulpit, a platform for him as a minister and professor of moral leadership at Emory University to offer a message of clarity in a turbulent time. And on what would be his last day in office, a Sunday, he said, he would leave with a benediction for Mr. Lewis and his work. Mr. Hall envisions leaping in with an aggressive agenda: working to decriminalize marijuana, expunge the records of formerly incarcerated people, create economic opportunity. \u201cI can do the equivalent of what I did in 15 years \u2014 I can do it in 15 days,\u201d he said, referring to his years on the Atlanta City Council. \u201cI know what not to waste my time on. I know how to be effective.\u201d The history of Congress is dotted with members whose terms were best measured in days. For the most part, any achievements recorded by history were largely symbolic. In fact, the first woman to serve in the Senate came from Georgia: Rebecca Latimer Felton, an 87-year-old writer and activist who was appointed in 1922 after her predecessor died, served one day and gave one speech. In it, she shared her vision of a Senate where more women would serve: \u201cYou will get ability, you will get integrity of purpose, you will get exalted patriotism, and you will get unstinted usefulness.\u201d In all likelihood, the experience for Mr. Hall or Dr. Franklin will be less grand or productive: votes on some significant legislation, including bills on government funding, and opportunities to speak on the House floor. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to get anything done in a short period of time, especially in this short period of time,\u201d said Michael Crespin, the director of the Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center at the University of Oklahoma. There is no shortage of attention being paid to Georgia politics at the moment, but this campaign has stood little chance of competing against recounted ballots, Senate runoffs, intraparty feuding among Georgia Republicans and a Democrat taking the state in a presidential race for the first time since 1992. It does not help that the campaign was part of a tangle of procedures after Mr. Lewis\u2019s death that left voters confused. Mr. Lewis had an almost singular presence in Atlanta, embraced as a link to connect a new generation of Black Lives Matter activists to the civil rights movement that was rooted in the city. Mr. Hall, 49, said he was well-suited to carrying on that legacy even though he thought he was done with politics. His last campaign had been a failed mayoral bid in 2017. He had shifted to business, working in economic development and consulting. But around the time of Mr. Lewis\u2019s death, a coronavirus diagnosis confined Mr. Hall to his bed and forced him to contemplate the future. On a recent morning, as he joined volunteers packing boxes with hand sanitizer and canned goods, he flipped through photographs on his phone. They were yellowing pictures of his father, Leon W. Hall, a civil rights activist and one of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s youngest lieutenants. In one, his father embraced Mr. Lewis. Another one made him tear up; it showed his father being dragged by a police officer during a demonstration. Those photographs offered the nudge he needed. \u201cYou find yourself exactly where you are supposed to be,\u201d he said. Dr. Franklin, 66, said he waited to see who else might run, like Shirley Franklin, the former mayor of Atlanta, or Andrew Young, who held the seat before Mr. Lewis and who had also been mayor. \u201cOK,\u201d he decided, \u201cI need to offer my leadership.\u201d No matter the result, he said, the campaign could be a prelude to a new chapter of holding elected office or perhaps serving as an ambassador. \u201cI am by no means equal to the task,\u201d he said of trying to fill the void left by Mr. Lewis, \u201cbut I think I could contribute something, even if it is for just two weeks.\u201d",

    "article_text": "9 questions about the Georgia Senate runoffs you were too embarrassed to ask  Georgia voters will determine which party controls the US Senate on January 5, and thus decide the fate of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. There are not one but two runoff Senate elections in Georgia early next year. They have similar dynamics, with Democratic challengers going up against Republican incumbents. One race features a matchup between Sen. David Perdue (R) and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other involves Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters who requested them starting on November 18, while in-person early voting starts on December 14 and continues until Election Day on January 5. At first glance, Democrats appear to be the underdogs. Georgia is historically Republican, and Democrats haven\u2019t had a good track record in past Senate runoffs, losing the most recent one in 2008. At the same time, Democrats insist several things are different this year: Their party\u2019s presidential nominee won the state for the first time in almost 30 years, they have two candidates, and the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance. Enthusiasm against President Trump ultimately aided Biden in the presidential election, and Democrats are clearly hoping for a repeat on that front. But the big unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s continued refusal to concede will play into all of this. \u201cTrump is not on the ballot, but are we in a post-Trump era where our people are motivated to show up?\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cThat is the big question.\u201d Georgia\u2019s runoff system is unusual in American politics, and the dynamics this year are also unusual. The results of these races will potentially have an outsize influence on the next four years.  We\u2019ve broken down the essential questions here.   There\u2019s a huge amount at stake for both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia. The state will decide which party controls the US Senate \u2014 and, by extension, whether there will be divided or unified government in Washington, DC. \u201cDemocrats are going to be very excited in Georgia but also nationally,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock recently told Vox. \u201cOssoff and Warnock, any kind of resource or help they need, they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Republicans are equally energized to keep the Senate in GOP hands so they can have a definitive say in the agenda of President-elect Biden. The ambitiousness of Biden\u2019s agenda as president hangs in the balance, as does his ability to select Cabinet members and judicial nominees \u2014 all of whom are confirmed by the Senate. The only problem: Many Republicans cannot publicly admit that Biden has officially won without angering Trump. Being hamstrung hampers their argument on this front.  \u201cWe\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be standing out here alone,\u201d Perdue said on a recent private donor call obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can\u2019t wait for that.\u201d To be clear, winning both seats won\u2019t give Democrats license to pass a raft of leftist legislation. Democrats\u2019 best-case scenario right now is a 50-50 split Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote for a simple majority.  But Democrats still have a number of conservative members in their caucus like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), who will likely temper their ambition and prioritize bipartisan cooperation with Republicans. They\u2019ll also likely have to deal with the Senate filibuster, needing 60 votes to pass major bills.  Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s Georgia rally was supposed to pump up Loeffler and Perdue. It ended up being a grievance-fest. Outgoing President Donald Trump traveled to Valdosta, Georgia, on Saturday for a rally that was ostensibly meant to pump up voters and encourage them to support Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue ahead of next month\u2019s runoff elections. But, perhaps unsurprisingly, Trump ended up having a hard time talking about anything but himself and his grievances. Trump\u2019s trip to Georgia for his first post-election rally came as he continues to push lies about the election being stolen from him \u2014 and as he makes a last-ditch push for Republican-controlled legislatures to overturn the election results. Much of Trump\u2019s remarks consisted of variations on these themes, and his insistence that the election was rigged against him in states he lost, like Georgia, was at tension with the idea it\u2019s important for Republicans to turn out for Loeffler and Perdue.  That incoherency was evident throughout Trump\u2019s speech on Saturday, which began with him brazenly lying that he actually won Georgia. \u201cWe won Georgia, just so you understand,\u201d Trump said, even though his loss in the state has already been certified by Georgia election officials. Trump ended up repeating this lie so many times throughout his speech that by the end of it he was mentioning it in passing as if it\u2019s settled fact. Despite his insistence that the Georgia Republicans who run the state at best looked the other way while Democrats conspired to steal the election from him, Trump at other points urged his fans to go out and vote for Loeffler and Perdue, saying things like, \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote, the socialists and communists win.\u201d  But what the president didn\u2019t bother trying to explain is why Republican voters should have any confidence the runoffs won\u2019t be rigged just like he says the presidential election was, given that they will be run by the same officials. Both Georgia senators are in tight races, and the slim margin by which Trump lost the state would make it seem that even a slightly depressed turnout could cost Loeffler and Perdue their seats come January. And should they both lose, Democrats will regain control of the Senate thanks to the tiebreaking vote of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Republicans were counting on the president to help provide both candidates with some momentum. But the downside of Trump\u2019s difficulty talking about anything other than himself or the alleged terribleness of other people became evident when Loeffler and Perdue took the stage to tepid applause. Their brief remarks were truncated by \u201cfight for Trump!\u201d chants that drowned them out. The Georgia rally came hours after Trump reportedly phoned Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, and asked him to convene a special session of the legislature to overturn the election results. Kemp reportedly turned Trump down, and perhaps as a result, Trump attacked him a number of times throughout his speech, at one point telling his fans, \u201cYour governor should be ashamed of himself.\u201d Then, toward the end of the rally, Trump outlined the desperate two-front battle he\u2019s trying to fight to overturn the election, saying, \u201chopefully our legislatures and the United States Supreme Court will step forward and save our country.\u201d But since neither Republican-controlled state legislatures or the Supreme Court have thus far shown much inclination to get involved in an election President-elect Joe Biden clearly won, Trump appears to have a backup plan \u2014 one he expressed in a fittingly incoherent manner. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win back the White House. We\u2019re gonna win it back,\u201d Trump said, teasing a 2024 run, but he then immediately added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait until 2024. I want to go back three weeks.\u201d Unfortunately for Trump, there\u2019s no do-overs. But in the meantime, his refusal to concede has led to a fundraising bonanza that could end up helping him launch a bid to avenge his loss to Biden, based on the \u201cthey stole it from me\u201d lies he\u2019s been pushing over the month since Election Day.",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s legal team advances yet another far-fetched lawsuit in Georgia President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has filed yet another lawsuit contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, this time calling for a complete do-over of the election in Georgia. That\u2019s despite two recounts in the state \u2014 overseen by Republican officials \u2014 both indicating Biden\u2019s victory in the state is unambiguous and not going to change. Trump\u2019s new lawsuit, filed in a Georgia state court on Friday, represents the latest of dozens of efforts by his campaign and its allies to contest the legitimacy of vote counts in key states across the nation, all of which have failed to gain traction \u2014 or even be taken seriously by judges \u2014 with the exception of one minor win involving an insignificant number of ballots. But while Trump\u2019s quixotic legal efforts and evidence-free claims of voter fraud have no chance at overturning the results of the presidential election, according to legal experts, they continue to shape Republicans\u2019 widespread reluctance to acknowledge the legitimacy of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s incoming administration, potentially setting the stage for even higher levels of polarization in Washington than before.       According to ABC News, Trump\u2019s latest Georgia lawsuit alleges that the state\u2019s election code was \u201cdisregarded, abandoned, ignored, altered, and otherwise violated,\u201d resulting in \u201ca sufficient number of illegal votes\u201d being included in the count. The lawsuit takes issue with rule changes regarding the eligibility of ballots, and includes allegations of fraud \u201cbased on witness affidavits, but with little evidence,\u201d ABC\u2019s Olivia Rubin and Matthew Mosk report. Trump\u2019s team is using these claims to call for \u201ca new Presidential Election to occur at the earliest opportune time.\u201d Georgia is in the midst of its third tally of votes overseen by Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, and Biden\u2019s margin of victory, while narrow, appears firm. Georgia\u2019s unprecedented hand-count audit confirmed Biden\u2019s victory over Trump, modestly reducing his margin of victory from 13,558 votes to 12,284 votes. And on Friday, preliminary results of a machine recount of the votes indicated that Biden is on track for a similar margin of victory on the third count of the ballots. The day that Trump\u2019s team filed the Georgia lawsuit, they also suffered two more legal defeats. In Nevada, a district judge denied a lawsuit from the Trump campaign contesting the state\u2019s results based on allegations of malfeasance. The judge said the legal team \u201cfailed to meet their burden to provide credible and relevant evidence.\u201d And the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to hear Trump\u2019s lawsuit attempting to overturn his loss. Trump and his allies have filed at least 46 lawsuits across the country and their efforts have gone poorly, with even conservative and Trump-appointed judges writing scathing rejections of lawsuits bereft of credible evidence of election official misconduct, incompetence, or fraud. Earlier this week, Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop summarized the state of Trump\u2019s \u201cstop the steal\u201d politicking: \u201cThe lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors.\u201d Trump has called on those state legislative leaders to aid him in stealing the election by appointing electors to the Electoral College who are willing to ignore the results of the election in their states and cast their votes for him rather than for Biden.  As Prokop has explained, this scheme would be difficult to pull off in states in which the GOP isn\u2019t in control of the legislature, courts, and governorship \u2014 and is also one that has been routinely rejected by Republican lawmakers in swing states like Michigan. Only in Pennsylvania have GOP lawmakers endorsed such a plan, and there, their plans appear set to be foiled by the state\u2019s Democratic House and governor. This leaves lawsuits as the president\u2019s only remaining avenue for overturning the election\u2019s results. But these lawsuits have become so transparently filed in bad faith that state and local officials are beginning to call for judges to sanction Trump campaign and Republican lawyers.  Legal experts aren\u2019t ruling out the possibility that judges could use financial penalties to deter future lawsuits, since Trump\u2019s legal efforts in many states have involve repeatedly bringing recycled, discredited claims and affidavits to court, a practice that could be deemed abusive. \u201cYou could see a court saying, \u2018Enough is enough,\u2019\u201d Daniel Weiner, deputy director of New York University\u2019s Brennan Center election reform program, told ABC News. Despite Biden\u2019s decisive victory in the Electoral College, and the dozens of lawsuits failing to gain any traction, the majority of Republican lawmakers in Washington have declined to question their legitimacy or acknowledge Biden\u2019s status as incoming president.  This week, the Washington Post surveyed every Republican in Congress, and found that fewer than 30 were willing to acknowledge Biden\u2019s victory over Trump. Meanwhile more than 200 Republican members of the House and Senate would \u201csimply not say who won the election.\u201d Trump responded to the results of the Post\u2019s survey with anger, and suggested he wanted to retaliate against the small minority of Republicans who acknowledged he lost the election. \u201cI am surprised there are so many,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday. \u201cWe have just begun to fight. Please send me a list of the 25 RINOS.\u201d RINO is an acronym which stands for \u201cRepublican in name only,\u201d typically used on the right to criticize a Republican for being insufficiently conservative. Trump\u2019s extended legal battles, combined with his weeks-long insistence on Twitter and other platforms that the election was rigged, have also had a strong effect on public opinion.  For example, a mid-November Economist/YouGov poll found that 89 percent of Trump voters believe that voter fraud affected the election outcome, and a majority think it changed the outcome.  While Trump\u2019s legal fights have surfaced no evidence of widespread fraud or misconduct, they have successfully lent credibility to his campaign to convince large swaths of the public that the election was stolen. And that might be their most important legacy.         ",

    "article_text": "9 questions about the Georgia Senate runoffs you were too embarrassed to ask  Georgia voters will determine which party controls the US Senate on January 5, and thus decide the fate of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. There are not one but two runoff Senate elections in Georgia early next year. They have similar dynamics, with Democratic challengers going up against Republican incumbents. One race features a matchup between Sen. David Perdue (R) and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other involves Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters who requested them starting on November 18, while in-person early voting starts on December 14 and continues until Election Day on January 5. At first glance, Democrats appear to be the underdogs. Georgia is historically Republican, and Democrats haven\u2019t had a good track record in past Senate runoffs, losing the most recent one in 2008. At the same time, Democrats insist several things are different this year: Their party\u2019s presidential nominee won the state for the first time in almost 30 years, they have two candidates, and the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance. Enthusiasm against President Trump ultimately aided Biden in the presidential election, and Democrats are clearly hoping for a repeat on that front. But the big unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s continued refusal to concede will play into all of this. \u201cTrump is not on the ballot, but are we in a post-Trump era where our people are motivated to show up?\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cThat is the big question.\u201d Georgia\u2019s runoff system is unusual in American politics, and the dynamics this year are also unusual. The results of these races will potentially have an outsize influence on the next four years.  We\u2019ve broken down the essential questions here.   There\u2019s a huge amount at stake for both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia. The state will decide which party controls the US Senate \u2014 and, by extension, whether there will be divided or unified government in Washington, DC. \u201cDemocrats are going to be very excited in Georgia but also nationally,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock recently told Vox. \u201cOssoff and Warnock, any kind of resource or help they need, they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Republicans are equally energized to keep the Senate in GOP hands so they can have a definitive say in the agenda of President-elect Biden. The ambitiousness of Biden\u2019s agenda as president hangs in the balance, as does his ability to select Cabinet members and judicial nominees \u2014 all of whom are confirmed by the Senate. The only problem: Many Republicans cannot publicly admit that Biden has officially won without angering Trump. Being hamstrung hampers their argument on this front.  \u201cWe\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be standing out here alone,\u201d Perdue said on a recent private donor call obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can\u2019t wait for that.\u201d To be clear, winning both seats won\u2019t give Democrats license to pass a raft of leftist legislation. Democrats\u2019 best-case scenario right now is a 50-50 split Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote for a simple majority.  But Democrats still have a number of conservative members in their caucus like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), who will likely temper their ambition and prioritize bipartisan cooperation with Republicans. They\u2019ll also likely have to deal with the Senate filibuster, needing 60 votes to pass major bills.  Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",

Many polls, especially in Midwestern states and in Maine, vastly overestimated Democratic performance. The polls predicted that Joe Biden would win the presidential race, and he did, but he had comfortable polling leads in several states that turned out to be much closer. That said, pollsters in Georgia did a pretty good job with the presidential and Senate races. The FiveThirtyEight polling average predicted that Biden would win the state by 1.2 points. He wound up winning by 0.2 points. So the polls were only off by 1 percentage point, and close in the initial Senate races, too. That suggests that Georgia polling is more reliable than the polls in many other states. Which brings us to a new SurveyUSA poll looking at the January 5 runoff elections in Georgia, which will decide which party controls the United States Senate (SurveyUSA is an \u201cA\u201d rated pollster, according to FiveThirtyEight). The topline in this poll is that Democrat Raphael Warnock leads appointed Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler by a 52-45 margin. Meanwhile, Democrat Jon Ossoff leads incumbent Republican Sen. David Purdue by a smaller 50-48 margin.  This poll is just one snapshot of the race. But if Democrats do win both seats, the incoming Senate would be evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, which means that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would hold the tie-breaking vote and Sen. Chuck Schumer would be majority leader (though Republicans would likely still be able to filibuster most legislation). One interesting thing about the SurveyUSA poll is that it offers a window into whether Republican turnout is likely to drop because of efforts by President Trump and his allies to diminish confidence in US elections. Briefly, the poll suggests that a small but significant number of Georgia Republicans do plan to sit out the election due to those efforts \u2014 enough to potentially flip these races to Warnock and Ossoff. Even before many outlets had called the 2020 race for Biden, Trump and his allies started touting evidence-free claims that Trump only lost because of widespread voter fraud. Trump campaign lawyers and lawyers aligned with the campaign also filed a series of meritless lawsuits challenging the election results or seeking to prevent states from certifying Biden\u2019s victory. These lawsuits have accomplished little, if anything. Trump has also attacked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp, both of whom are Republicans, for supposedly enabling voter fraud in that state. Again, there is no evidence that such fraud exists. Some of Trump\u2019s allies have even gone so far as to urge Republicans to boycott the Georgia runoff elections. At a rally in Atlanta this week, for example, former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell said that she \u201cwould encourage all Georgians to make it known that you will not vote at all until your vote is secure.\u201d These attempts to undermine confidence in the Georgia runoff elections appear to be having an effect. The SurveyUSA poll interviewed a total of 717 registered voters, 118 of whom said they are not likely to vote in the runoff. Of these likely non-voters, 13 percent said they planned not to vote because \u201cthe voting process is rigged.\u201d Another 5 percent said they are \u201cintentionally boycotting the runoff.\u201d To be clear, 118 respondents is a very small sample size, so no one should take these figures as gospel. But there\u2019s other evidence that Republicans are more likely to sit out the January 5 runoffs than Democrats. As data journalist Nate Silver notes, the poll suggests that the January electorate could be 3 to 4 points more Democratic than the voters who turned out in November. In other words, if Warnock and Ossoff do prevail next month, they could have Trump and Trump allies like Sidney Powell to thank for their victory. Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine confidence in the election are likely to be ignored by Democrats, but they appear to be resonating with at least some Republicans.  And in two close elections, if even a small fraction of Republicans decide that their votes won\u2019t matter, that could swing both races to Democrats.",

    "article_text": "9 questions about the Georgia Senate runoffs you were too embarrassed to ask  Georgia voters will determine which party controls the US Senate on January 5, and thus decide the fate of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. There are not one but two runoff Senate elections in Georgia early next year. They have similar dynamics, with Democratic challengers going up against Republican incumbents. One race features a matchup between Sen. David Perdue (R) and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other involves Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters who requested them starting on November 18, while in-person early voting starts on December 14 and continues until Election Day on January 5. At first glance, Democrats appear to be the underdogs. Georgia is historically Republican, and Democrats haven\u2019t had a good track record in past Senate runoffs, losing the most recent one in 2008. At the same time, Democrats insist several things are different this year: Their party\u2019s presidential nominee won the state for the first time in almost 30 years, they have two candidates, and the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance. Enthusiasm against President Trump ultimately aided Biden in the presidential election, and Democrats are clearly hoping for a repeat on that front. But the big unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s continued refusal to concede will play into all of this. \u201cTrump is not on the ballot, but are we in a post-Trump era where our people are motivated to show up?\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cThat is the big question.\u201d Georgia\u2019s runoff system is unusual in American politics, and the dynamics this year are also unusual. The results of these races will potentially have an outsize influence on the next four years.  We\u2019ve broken down the essential questions here.   There\u2019s a huge amount at stake for both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia. The state will decide which party controls the US Senate \u2014 and, by extension, whether there will be divided or unified government in Washington, DC. \u201cDemocrats are going to be very excited in Georgia but also nationally,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock recently told Vox. \u201cOssoff and Warnock, any kind of resource or help they need, they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Republicans are equally energized to keep the Senate in GOP hands so they can have a definitive say in the agenda of President-elect Biden. The ambitiousness of Biden\u2019s agenda as president hangs in the balance, as does his ability to select Cabinet members and judicial nominees \u2014 all of whom are confirmed by the Senate. The only problem: Many Republicans cannot publicly admit that Biden has officially won without angering Trump. Being hamstrung hampers their argument on this front.  \u201cWe\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be standing out here alone,\u201d Perdue said on a recent private donor call obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can\u2019t wait for that.\u201d To be clear, winning both seats won\u2019t give Democrats license to pass a raft of leftist legislation. Democrats\u2019 best-case scenario right now is a 50-50 split Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote for a simple majority.  But Democrats still have a number of conservative members in their caucus like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), who will likely temper their ambition and prioritize bipartisan cooperation with Republicans. They\u2019ll also likely have to deal with the Senate filibuster, needing 60 votes to pass major bills.  Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",

    "article_text": "9 questions about the Georgia Senate runoffs you were too embarrassed to ask  Georgia voters will determine which party controls the US Senate on January 5, and thus decide the fate of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. There are not one but two runoff Senate elections in Georgia early next year. They have similar dynamics, with Democratic challengers going up against Republican incumbents. One race features a matchup between Sen. David Perdue (R) and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other involves Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters who requested them starting on November 18, while in-person early voting starts on December 14 and continues until Election Day on January 5. At first glance, Democrats appear to be the underdogs. Georgia is historically Republican, and Democrats haven\u2019t had a good track record in past Senate runoffs, losing the most recent one in 2008. At the same time, Democrats insist several things are different this year: Their party\u2019s presidential nominee won the state for the first time in almost 30 years, they have two candidates, and the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance. Enthusiasm against President Trump ultimately aided Biden in the presidential election, and Democrats are clearly hoping for a repeat on that front. But the big unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s continued refusal to concede will play into all of this. \u201cTrump is not on the ballot, but are we in a post-Trump era where our people are motivated to show up?\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cThat is the big question.\u201d Georgia\u2019s runoff system is unusual in American politics, and the dynamics this year are also unusual. The results of these races will potentially have an outsize influence on the next four years.  We\u2019ve broken down the essential questions here.   There\u2019s a huge amount at stake for both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia. The state will decide which party controls the US Senate \u2014 and, by extension, whether there will be divided or unified government in Washington, DC. \u201cDemocrats are going to be very excited in Georgia but also nationally,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock recently told Vox. \u201cOssoff and Warnock, any kind of resource or help they need, they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Republicans are equally energized to keep the Senate in GOP hands so they can have a definitive say in the agenda of President-elect Biden. The ambitiousness of Biden\u2019s agenda as president hangs in the balance, as does his ability to select Cabinet members and judicial nominees \u2014 all of whom are confirmed by the Senate. The only problem: Many Republicans cannot publicly admit that Biden has officially won without angering Trump. Being hamstrung hampers their argument on this front.  \u201cWe\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be standing out here alone,\u201d Perdue said on a recent private donor call obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can\u2019t wait for that.\u201d To be clear, winning both seats won\u2019t give Democrats license to pass a raft of leftist legislation. Democrats\u2019 best-case scenario right now is a 50-50 split Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote for a simple majority.  But Democrats still have a number of conservative members in their caucus like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), who will likely temper their ambition and prioritize bipartisan cooperation with Republicans. They\u2019ll also likely have to deal with the Senate filibuster, needing 60 votes to pass major bills.  Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox.

Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",

    "article_text": "9 questions about the Georgia Senate runoffs you were too embarrassed to ask  Georgia voters will determine which party controls the US Senate on January 5, and thus decide the fate of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. There are not one but two runoff Senate elections in Georgia early next year. They have similar dynamics, with Democratic challengers going up against Republican incumbents. One race features a matchup between Sen. David Perdue (R) and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other involves Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) and Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters who requested them starting on November 18, while in-person early voting starts on December 14 and continues until Election Day on January 5. At first glance, Democrats appear to be the underdogs. Georgia is historically Republican, and Democrats haven\u2019t had a good track record in past Senate runoffs, losing the most recent one in 2008. At the same time, Democrats insist several things are different this year: Their party\u2019s presidential nominee won the state for the first time in almost 30 years, they have two candidates, and the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance. Enthusiasm against President Trump ultimately aided Biden in the presidential election, and Democrats are clearly hoping for a repeat on that front. But the big unknown factor is how Trump\u2019s continued refusal to concede will play into all of this. \u201cTrump is not on the ballot, but are we in a post-Trump era where our people are motivated to show up?\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cThat is the big question.\u201d Georgia\u2019s runoff system is unusual in American politics, and the dynamics this year are also unusual. The results of these races will potentially have an outsize influence on the next four years.  We\u2019ve broken down the essential questions here.   There\u2019s a huge amount at stake for both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia. The state will decide which party controls the US Senate \u2014 and, by extension, whether there will be divided or unified government in Washington, DC. \u201cDemocrats are going to be very excited in Georgia but also nationally,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock recently told Vox. \u201cOssoff and Warnock, any kind of resource or help they need, they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Republicans are equally energized to keep the Senate in GOP hands so they can have a definitive say in the agenda of President-elect Biden. The ambitiousness of Biden\u2019s agenda as president hangs in the balance, as does his ability to select Cabinet members and judicial nominees \u2014 all of whom are confirmed by the Senate. The only problem: Many Republicans cannot publicly admit that Biden has officially won without angering Trump. Being hamstrung hampers their argument on this front.  \u201cWe\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be standing out here alone,\u201d Perdue said on a recent private donor call obtained by the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can\u2019t wait for that.\u201d To be clear, winning both seats won\u2019t give Democrats license to pass a raft of leftist legislation. Democrats\u2019 best-case scenario right now is a 50-50 split Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote for a simple majority.  But Democrats still have a number of conservative members in their caucus like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), who will likely temper their ambition and prioritize bipartisan cooperation with Republicans. They\u2019ll also likely have to deal with the Senate filibuster, needing 60 votes to pass major bills.  Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws.

In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so.

Certainly, the biggest thing at stake for Biden and Democrats is whether Senate Majority Mitch McConnell remains in his current role. McConnell has the power to hold up virtually any appointment of Biden\u2019s \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the judiciary or his Cabinet \u2014 making the real stakes more about whether the federal government can function. Hopes of bipartisan legislation might be something of a long shot with McConnell in charge. Last year, the majority leader vowed to be the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for Democratic legislation in the House, and he famously stonewalled President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and Cabinet picks as minority leader in 2009 and 2010, until then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blew up the Senate filibuster.  McConnell and Biden have a long history together in the Senate, and McConnell is so far keeping his powder dry on how he intends to work with (or against) Biden, depending on the outcome in Georgia. But McConnell is a savvy operator, and he could be the biggest roadblock to even incremental progress if he keeps control of the Senate.  Unlike the winner-takes-all system most states use, Georgia operates a bit differently. If a candidate doesn\u2019t hit the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright, they and their opponent both head to a runoff election.  Georgia is one of 10 states with a system of runoff elections. These states are primarily in the South, although Vermont also uses runoffs. It\u2019s not necessarily a coincidence that Southern states use runoffs, which are a relic of one-party dominance, and a means to suppress Black votes, historians recently told Vox\u2019s Jerusalem Demsas. As Demsas detailed in a recent explainer, Georgia\u2019s runoff system effectively started in 1962. It was helmed by then-state Rep. Denmark Groover, a \u201cstaunch segregationist\u201d who had lost one of his elections in the \u201950s due to the strength of the Black vote in his district. As a 2007 Interior Department report explained:  In the 1990s, the US Department of Justice even sued to overturn the state\u2019s runoff system, alleging it had \u201ca demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of blacks to become candidates for public office\u201d and calling the requirement \u201can electoral steroid for white candidates.\u201d Some political scientists have said it\u2019s tough to know for certain if runoffs have had the intended effect of suppressing the political power of Black voters and candidates. Even so, this system has persisted in Georgia for decades.  In the first race, there\u2019s a matchup between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is the former CEO of companies including Reebok and Dollar General. He\u2019s also the cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (the current US secretary of agriculture).  Perdue is a strong Trump ally, and was an early Senate endorser of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign. In a 2016 op-ed, Perdue wrote that he and Trump had a similar backstory, which he characterized as outsider businessmen underestimated by establishment Republicans. \u201cThrough my own experience, I probably understand the Trump phenomenon and the new reality of this electorate better than most,\u201d Perdue wrote. He\u2019s running against Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist who ran for Congress in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District in 2017, narrowly losing to Republican Karen Handel in a runoff. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the district \u2014 which in an earlier iteration belonged to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. McBath held the district again in 2020, while Democrats also picked up the neighboring Seventh Congressional District. Even though Ossoff narrowly lost in 2017, many Democrats in the Atlanta metro area credit his campaign with galvanizing and organizing a cohort of white suburban women, in particular. \u201cIt was almost like it turned on a light in the state where you could see you weren\u2019t the only Democrat,\u201d state Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat, told Vox. \u201cJon runs for this congressional [seat] and all of a sudden you see these women in the Atlanta suburbs coming out in droves to support him and work for him.\u201d In the other race, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock. A former CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of Georgia\u2019s WNBA team, Loeffler is less of a known entity than Perdue in Georgia politics; she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson.  Loeffler was appointed largely to stem the bleeding of suburban women from the Georgia Republican party, the logic being that a Republican woman candidate would appeal to these women. But her 2020 race was in large part defined her tacking hard to the right, in large part due to a primary challenge from Rep. Doug Collins, a Trump loyalist. Loeffler sought and won the endorsement of Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who espouses the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. Warnock is the senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached in the 1960s. Like his Republican competitor, Warnock is also relatively new to politics. He\u2019s a prominent figure in Atlanta\u2019s Black community, and delivered the eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by Atlanta police this summer. Even though these are distinct races, the Democratic and Republican campaigns are running in a unified way. Ossoff and Warnock have appeared together for joint events, and Perdue\u2019s campaign has spent time attacking Warnock in recent press releases, calling Ossoff Warnock\u2019s \u201crunning mate.\u201d Perdue and Loeffler are running a similar strategy, having \u201cfully integrated our teams,\u201d Perdue said on the call obtained by the Post. If conventional wisdom is to be believed, Perdue and Loeffler are the likely favorites to win. Georgia leans Republican, and its voters haven\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate in 20 years. Even though Biden narrowly won Georgia in the presidential election, this isn\u2019t necessarily a good indication of Democratic strength in the Senate races. The data we have shows that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump by about 780 votes. Ossoff, on the other hand, ran close to 100,000 votes short of Biden. (It\u2019s tough to make the same comparison with Loeffler and Warnock because they were running in a field of 20 candidates.) These numbers mean that Biden\u2019s strength at the top of the ticket didn\u2019t necessarily translate to down-ballot races. It helped force a runoff, but there\u2019s no guarantee Democrats will do well the second time around.  \u201cIn pre-Trump-era runoffs, there\u2019s no way a Democrat is going to win,\u201d a Democratic pollster told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t care how quickly the state is moving with a growing [bloc of] white college-educated voters. You need to have anti-Trump enthusiasm at the same levels as we saw throughout his presidency.\u201d It\u2019s an open question for Democrats whether the same number of voters who wanted Trump out will come back to the polls on January 5 \u2014 or if they will stay home, now satisfied with getting Trump out of the White House. If more of these Biden voters stay home, or ultimately decide to vote for Perdue and Loeffler, it\u2019s likely over for the Democratic candidates. But if Trump is still unwilling to concede the election, and Perdue and Loeffler back him, that could energize these voters again.  Recent polls show a tight race. A November 17 InsiderAdvantage/Fox 5 Atlanta Poll found both races essentially tied, with Warnock one point ahead of Loeffler, 49 to 48 percent, and Ossoff and Perdue tied at 49 percent. Another recent poll by a Republican firm found Loeffler and Warnock statistically tied, and Perdue with a small advantage over Warnock \u2014 50 to 46 percent.  Of course, there\u2019s a caveat about not putting too much stock in polls. Many 2020 Senate race polls were off, underestimating Republicans\u2019 advantage. Polls in Georgia proved to be more accurate than many other states, but the numbers should be considered a snapshot in time and will likely change.  Bottom line: While Democrats are still considered the underdogs, they have a chance in a state growing more competitive.  While there were likely a small number of split-ticket voters in Georgia\u2019s November election who cast a ballot for Biden and Republican candidates down the ballot, this may not necessarily translate to success for Democrats in the Senate races.  Biden running so far ahead of Ossoff and Perdue running slightly ahead of Trump suggests that some moderate Republicans may have checked the box for Biden at the top of the ticket before voting for Republicans down-ballot as well.  \u201cI don\u2019t think voters appreciate the amount of ticket-splitting that went on,\u201d Buzz Brockway, a Republican and former Georgia state House member, said. \u201cThere was a section of voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Trump but voted for Republicans the rest of the ticket.\u201d It\u2019s important to distinguish between ticket-splitting during the presidential election and ticket-splitting during the Senate runoff race, where ticket splitters would vote for one Democratic candidate as well as one Republican. It certainly could happen, but two runoff races mean Republicans and Democrats are ostensibly campaigning as a team. Ticket-splitting in this year\u2019s presidential election was more about Trump than anything else. It helps explain Trump\u2019s loss combined with Republicans simultaneously having a better year than expected. A lot of these voters live in suburban areas and identify as moderate. They typically have higher incomes, and they dislike Trump, according to a recent nationwide analysis by Navigator Survey.  While these voters played a role in Georgia\u2019s presidential race, they probably will settle on either voting straight Democrat or straight Republican in the runoffs. Remember, a runoff election is primarily about base mobilization. Fresh off a massive win by flipping Georgia in a presidential election for the first time since 1992, Democrats could face a steeper climb with the Senate race. \u201cThe [Atlanta] suburbs are the key to how this plays out, but the tricky thing for runoffs is it\u2019s more about motivation than persuasion,\u201d Georgia Democratic operative Stefan Turkheimer told Vox. In other words, turning out the base matters more in runoff elections than trying to persuade swing voters.  Democrats are trying to thread a tough needle. They need both high Black turnout and suburban white voters to back their candidates. Recent New York Times data shows that the relative proportion of Black turnout actually fell slightly in the 2020 presidential election compared to 2016 (though the raw numbers were up) and was much lower than the 2012 election. The data also showed that affluent, older, and college-educated white suburban voters, primarily in the Atlanta suburbs, propelled Biden to his narrow win in the state.  But these white suburbanites may need more persuasion to vote for Democrats \u2014 unless Trump continues to refuse to concede his election.  Now that these white suburbanites have successfully ousted Trump, it\u2019s far less certain they\u2019ll vote for two Democratic Senate candidates. Black voters still make up the core base of the Georgia Democratic Party, but the biggest question mark is hovering around these more moderate whites. Is Biden the extent of their Democratic voting? \u201cI think they\u2019re the wild card for this Senate race,\u201d Georgia Republican consultant Brian Robinson told Vox. \u201cHow many of them voted for Perdue and Loeffler? How many of them voted straight-ticket Democrat?\u201d We know that Perdue ran slightly ahead of Trump in 2020, but some Democrats think that you need to look at the bigger picture in Georgia, like the incredibly close 2018 governor\u2019s race between current Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Democrat Stacey Abrams.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying these suburban women are staying with us forever, but they\u2019ve stayed with us for two cycles, with two very different candidates,\u201d veteran Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Vox. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying the \u2018Romney Republican\u2019 now that they\u2019ve almost become reasonable Democrats.\u201d Much like the 2020 election, it could all come down to Trump. The GOP\u2019s message that keeping Georgia is the only thing standing in the way of unified Democratic control of the US Senate could get complicated by Trump.  Trump is unhappy about losing the presidency in general \u2014 but seems particularly aggrieved about the results in Georgia. The president is still refusing to concede the election to Biden, and has spent the past couple of weeks fighting very publicly with Republican Georgia state officials, including Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump recently called Raffensperger \u201can enemy of the people\u201d and said he was \u201cashamed\u201d that he endorsed Kemp in his 2018 governor\u2019s race.  Raffensperger has remained steadfast as a Georgia recount takes place, even as Loeffler and Perdue signed a letter calling on him to resign as they try to curry favor with Trump. Loeffler and Perdue\u2019s calculation here is clear: They can\u2019t afford to alienate Trump or his base in the state. Even though Democrats surpassed turnout expectations in 2020, so did Republicans \u2014 driven by the fact that Trump himself was on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s still critically important,\u201d said Brockway, the former Republican state representative. \u201cTrump, sort of like Barack Obama, brought people into the political process. Their first exposure to politics is Trump, and they don\u2019t necessarily view themselves as longtime loyal Republicans. They\u2019re Trump Republicans, and when their guy gets rejected, that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d That infighting taking top billing in the press has some Georgia Republicans worried that Trump\u2019s continued baseless claims about a rigged election and fixed voting machines in the state could cause his supporters to stay home. Even as he recently encouraged his supporters to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in the January runoffs, Trump continued to claim baseless voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.  Republicans have another fear too. Remembering that Trump motivated Democrats and independent-minded voters to come out in droves in November, the fact that the president is still refusing to concede to Biden could keep Democrats energized longer than under normal circumstances. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Trump will keep this up all the way until January \u2014 but he\u2019s showing no signs of accepting defeat in the shorter term. \u201cWhen there are warring factions within the Republican Party casting blame saying that we should not concede, with the president taking to Twitter and calling people out ... all that does, I think, is fire the Democratic base up,\u201d said Jason Downey, a Republican and the vice chair of the Georgia state Board of Education. The defining issue of the Georgia runoffs is control of the US Senate.  These races have just two outcomes: divided government in Washington split between a Democratic White House and US House, and a Republican-controlled Senate; and unified Democratic control in Washington. With the incoming Biden administration, the stakes are high. Both sides in Georgia are framing the race around these outcomes. Republicans are attacking Ossoff and Warnock as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d (Neither candidate identifies as socialist.) GOP mailers frame the Georgia race being \u201cAmerica\u2019s last line of defense from a socialist takeover.\u201d Republicans have especially been playing up comments Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made about flipping Georgia, where he said, \u201cNow we take Georgia, then we change America!\u201d \u201cAnybody would agree that Chuck Schumer is a savvy political mind, but he was playing to his audience in New York and he handed Georgia Republicans a huge gift with that clip,\u201d Robinson said. He added he believes Republicans and independents are \u201cscared of a Democratic Senate joining Pelosi and Biden. Fear will motivate much more strongly than any other emotion in the runoff.\u201d Democrats have also emphasized the stakes of Georgia, but they\u2019ve been framing the races more around a commonsense agenda to pass more Covid-19 relief, economic stimulus, and a jobs bill \u2014 legislation that is much less likely to come to fruition if Republicans keep the Senate.  Democrats argue that winning Georgia will give them a shot at governing and passing basic bills. Even if Democrats win 50 seats in the Senate, they will have to forge bipartisan compromise on big bills. There certainly will be no Medicare-for-all or Green New Deal passed even if Democrats manage to flip Georgia.  Ossoff and Warnock also have spent a lot of time talking about their Republican opponents\u2019 financial past, particularly stock trades the two made after they received classified briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic while they were in office. Perdue sold stocks in a casino company and invested in the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, while Loeffler\u2019s financial advisers sold stock in a company called Intercontinental Exchange, which operates global exchanges for financial and commodity markets and saw its stock drop during the pandemic. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and say that the trades were made by outside advisers, without their knowledge. The stock trading issue hasn\u2019t gone away, particularly for Perdue. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Brodey recently reported Perdue invested in a company that manufactured Navy submarine parts called BWX Technologies right around the time he became head of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Perdue\u2019s office told the Daily Beast that Perdue\u2019s stock investments are managed by outside financial advisers and done without his prior approval. Over the summer, Ossoff told Vox that if he\u2019s elected, anti-corruption reforms \u2014 including a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, a corporate PAC ban, and a ban on stock trading by sitting senators \u2014 will be his first priority in the Senate. That focus on anti-corruption is not a coincidence.  If it\u2019s before the December 7 registration deadline, then technically yes. But those who want to move to a state just to vote in an election need to be comfortable with the idea of staying there for a while.  Otherwise, it\u2019s against Georgia\u2019s laws. The deadline to register as a voter ahead of the runoffs is December 7, and Georgia law allows anyone with a legal primary residence in the state to register. However, the secretary of state\u2019s office has been very clear that moving to the state with the sole purpose of voting and then moving away could carry a felony sentence.  Georgia state law requires that those who register be \u201ca resident of this state and of the county or municipality in which he or she seeks to vote.\u201d The law adds that \u201cthe residence of any person shall be held to be in that place in which such person\u2019s habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.\u201d In a recent press release, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthis would include individuals who move to Georgia solely for the sake of casting a ballot in an election with no intention of remaining in the state.\u201d False registration \u2014 or registering to vote knowing they don\u2019t qualify in Georgia \u2014 is a state felony and carries a pretty stiff punishment: between one and 10 years in prison, and/or up to a $100,000 fine. In other words, if you were already planning a move to Georgia or just got a job in the state and would like to vote there in the January election, it\u2019s totally legal to do so. But if you\u2019re registered and live elsewhere and are planning to vote and leave immediately after, it\u2019s legally dubious.    ",

    "article_text": "Trump urges Georgia to vote in Senate runoffs at rally, still hits 'rigged' election With the Republican majority on the line in Georgia's Senate runoffs, President Trump returned\u00a0to the campaign trail Saturday for the first time since last month\u2019s presidential election. Along with first lady Melania Trump, he gave a night rally in Valdosta, Ga., for Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Trump described to the crowd how he saw the stakes\u00a0in the twin Senate runoffs.\u00a0 \"Very simply, you will decide whether your children will grow up in a socialist country or free country. Socialism is just the beginning for these people. They want to\u00a0go into a communistic form of government,\" the president continued.\u00a0 Trump said that Perdue's opponent, Jon Ossoff, and Loeffler's opponent, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, are the \"two most extreme, far-left, liberal candidates in history.\"\u00a0 Trump implored Georgians to vote, while still sowing distrust in the state's handling of elections.\u00a0 \"You must go vote, vote early. They cheated, they rigged our presidential election, but we will still win it. They're going to try and rig this election too.\" Trump then hit the state's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. \"Your governor could stop it very easily, if he knew what the hell he was doing.\" He said that Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger were \"afraid of Stacey Abrams,\" the former Democratic gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist.\u00a0 \"If I lost, I'd be a very gracious loser. If I lost, I'd go to Florida...but you can't ever accept what they steal and rig and rob. You can't accept it,\" Trump continued.\u00a0 Of the 2024 presidential election, Trump said, \"Hopefully, I\u00a0won't have to be a candidate.\" Just after the rally, the president took to Twitter to urge Georgians to register to vote before Monday, Dec. 12, and to request an absentee ballot before 12/31.\u00a0 \"The answer to the Democrat voter fraud is not to stay at home - that\u2019s what Pelosi and Schumer want you to do. If you want revenge on the Democrats for their efforts to steal the Presidential election, where we are fighting hard, you have to show up and vote in RECORD numbers!\" he added.\u00a0 Crowds of supporters lined up for hours\u00a0to attend the rally. Some even camped overnight, despite temperatures dropping to the mid-30s. As the\u00a0mostly maskless supporters stood in line waiting for temperature checks, a chant broke out: \"Stop the steal.\"\u00a0 On the eve of Trump\u2019s trip, Vice President Mike Pence -- in the Peach State for the second time since the kickoff of the twin Senate showdowns -- emphasized: \u201cPresident Trump and I need David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler back in the Republican majority in the United States Senate.\u201d BIDEN, OBAMA, PENCE, AND TRUMP WEIGH IN ON GEORGIA RUNOFFS Loeffler and Perdue are the\u00a0GOP candidates in the Jan. 5 elections, which will determine if Republicans hold the chamber, or if\u00a0Democrats control both the House and Senate, as well as the White House. AD SPENDING IN GEORGIA'S TWIN RUNOFF ELECTIONS SKYROCKETS \u00a0 Republicans desperately need Trump supporters to return to the polls a month from now, despite unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud in the Nov. 3 election. The balance of power for the next Senate coming out of last month\u2019s elections is 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats. That\u00a0means\u00a0Democrats must win both of Georgia\u2019s runoffs to make it a 50-50 split Senate. If that occurs, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote, giving her party a\u00a0razor-thin majority in the chamber. GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS SPUR PROBE INTO THIRD-PARTY GROUPS TRYING TO REGISTER OUT-OF-STATE VOTERS In Georgia, where state law dictates a runoff if no candidate garners\u00a050% of the vote, Perdue narrowly missed\u00a0avoiding a runoff, winning 49.75% of the vote. Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff\u00a0trailed by roughly 87,000 votes. In the other race, Loeffler captured nearly 26% of the vote in a whopping 20-candidate special election to fill the final two years of the term of former GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson. Democratic candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock won nearly 33% of the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important that Republicans are united in this fight against Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff,\u201d said Jesse Hunt, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the re-election arm of the Senate GOP.\u00a0 \u201cIt may sound clich\u00e9, but with two very consequential runoffs, turnout is critical.\u201d Hunt told Fox News that \u201cthe president\u2019s visit is going to be an event that energizes and mobilizes our Republican voters.\u201d The visit comes on the eve of Sunday\u2019s debate between Loeffler and Warnock, which will be\u00a0carried live nationally on Fox News. Trump continues to fight the results of the presidential contest in Georgia, a once solidly red state that\u2019s turned into a crucial battleground in recent years. President-elect Joe Biden carried the state by roughly 12,000 votes in last month\u2019s election. The results were backed up by a manual recount mandated by state officials. A second recount requested by the president, completed Friday, didn\u2019t alter the final result \u2013 and the election results were cerrtified. But as Biden prepares to take office, Trump has continued his assault\u00a0on the election. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE GEORGIA RUNOFFS The president this week tweeted or retweeted baseless charges of voter fraud in Georgia, and he\u2019s repeatedly attacked\u00a0Kemp and\u00a0 Raffensperger, who are both Trump supporters, for their refusal to\u00a0reverse the election results.  Conspiratorial claims by pro-Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Lin Wood this week further\u00a0roiled the waters. They filed lawsuits seeking to overturn Georgia\u2019s results. At a rally Wednesday, they went further, urging\u00a0GOP voters to not support Perdue and Loeffler, charging that the senators have not been supportive enough of Trump's\u00a0efforts to overturn the election. \u201cThey have not earned your vote. Don\u2019t you give it to them,\u201d Wood said. \u201cWhy would you go back and vote in another rigged election, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d That\u2019s got plenty of Republicans in Georgia pushing back. Former House Speaker and 2012 presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, who represented Georgia in Congress for decades, tweeted this week:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLin Wood and Sidney Powell are totally destructive. Every Georgia conservative who cares about America MUST vote in the runoff.\u201d Gabriel Sterling, a top Georgia election official and a Republican, predicted that voter fraud allegations\u00a0by Trump and his allies will\u00a0drive down GOP turnout in the Senate runoffs. \u201cAt this point, there\u2019s no way that it can\u2019t,\u201d he told CNN in an interview this week. On Friday, as his legal team filed a new lawsuit in Georgia, Trump tied the runoffs to his push to reverse the state\u2019s presidential election results as he once again demanded a signature audit of ballots. \u201cThe best way to insure a @KLoeffler and @sendavidperdue VICTORY is to allow signature checks in the Presidential race, which will insure a Georgia Presidential win,\u201d the president claimed. And he argued that \u201cSpirits will soar and everyone will rush out and VOTE!\u201d But ahead of the president\u2019s trip, a dozen and a half leading Georgia Republicans issued a statement urging that the focus turn from attacks over the Nov. 3 results to the Senate runoffs. \u201cWe have watched with increasing concern as the debate surrounding the state\u2019s electoral\u00a0system has made some within our Party consider whether voting in the coming run-off election\u00a0matters, \" the statement read.\u00a0\u00a0\"We say today, without equivocation, that without every vote cast for President Trump\u00a0and all our Republican candidates on November 3 also being cast in the U.S. Senate runoffs, the\u00a0trajectory of our State and Nation will be irreparably altered on January 5th.\u00a0Now is the time to unite our Party and win these U.S. Senate seats.\" Among those signing the statement were former Republican Sens.\u00a0Isakson, Saxby Chambliss and Mack Mattingly, and former GOP Gov. Nathan Deal.",

The Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections adjourned a meeting Friday in which members voted to recertify the results of the 2020 presidential race in favor of President-elect Joe Biden in a 3-2 voice vote. Much of the meeting focused on a video that went viral Thursday, which political commentators claimed showed Fulton County election officials illegally stuffing ballots -- a form of election fraud in which more ballots are counted than were cast by eligible voters in a specific location. A senior source in Raffensperger's office\u00a0told\u00a0Fox\u00a0News that the video has\u00a0been investigated and claims that it showed ballot fraud deemed unfounded, adding that Fulton County election officials had a designated observer at the location the entire time -- a practice that has been in place since June. Raffensperger's office\u00a0also debunked allegations that the ballots were stuffed in\u00a0a pair of \"suitcases\" that one election official pulled out from beneath a table in the video, saying footage shows the ballots in the cases that they were supposed to be kept in.\u00a0 HANNITY ON SUSPICIOUS SUITCASE VIDEO Republican Georgia Rep. Jody Hice, however, shared the video on Twitter, calling the footage \"explosive fraud.\" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said during a Thursday interview on \"The Ingraham Angle\"\u00a0that\u00a0he has called for a signature audit into the video, but only the secretary of state has the power to order one. COLLINS IMPLORES GOP VOTERS TO TURN OUT FOR GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS: 'PEOPLE CANNOT GIVE UP ON THE SYSTEM' Georgia\u00a0election chief Gabe Sterling shared a fact-check article from a news outlet called Lead Stories in a Thursday tweet, saying, \"The 90-second video of election workers at State Farm arena, purporting to show fraud was watched in its entirety (hours) by\u00a0@GaSecofState investigators. Shows normal ballot processing. Here is the fact check on it.\" Fulton County Elections Director Richard Barron told the Board of Registration and Elections during Friday's hearing that he had not seen the video, but his staff told him the footage showed \"normal\" activity. Barron took questions from\u00a0Republican board members Kathleen Ruth and\u00a0Mark Wingate, who voted against certifying election results. In response to claims that staff and media left the counting site early, Barron said no one was told to leave early and that certain staff left after their duties concluded.

    "article_text": "Who are the groups at the center of the Georgia election investigation? A group at the center of the investigation into voter fraud recently opened by the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger hired contractors who were found to have forged ballot applications in 2014. The group, The New Georgia Project, was founded by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams to help register new voters. Ultimately, the 2014 investigation found no wrongdoing by the group, but did cite 14 people for forging 53 voter applications. All those cited were working as independent contractors, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. On Wednesday, Raffensperger announced an investigation into several progressive organizations he alleged \u201csought to register ineligible, out-of-state, or deceased voters\u201d for the Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections. Among those named are Vote Forward, The New Georgia Project, Operation Voter Registration GA and America Votes. GEORGIA GROUP FOUNDED BY STACEY ABRAMS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR SEEKING OUT-OF-STATE, DEAD VOTERS \u201cI have issued clear warnings several times to groups and individuals working to undermine the integrity of elections in Georgia through false and fraudulent registrations,\u201d said Raffensperger in a statement. \u201cThe security of Georgia\u2019s elections is of the utmost importance. We have received specific evidence that these groups have solicited voter registrations from ineligible individuals who have passed away or live out of state. I will investigate these claims thoroughly and take action against anyone attempting to undermine our elections.\u201d The New Georgia Project, which was led by Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock until February, is accused by Raffensperger of several election violations. Almost all of them involve sending voter registration or absentee application mail to people who were either deceased or ineligible to vote. The progressive nonprofit was founded in 2013 and works to build the progressive voting bloc in Georgia largely by registering young people to vote. In the 2018 election cycle, the New Georgia Project reported $96,000 in payments, with two payments worth a total of $35,000 going to the Working Families Party. FLORIDA ATTORNEY UNDER INVESTIGATION AFTER SAYING HE IS MOVING TO GEORGIA TO VOTE Vote Forward is a nonprofit founded by Scott Forman in 2017. The progressive group focuses on sending handwritten letters imploring people to vote. According to OpenSecrets, a campaign finance database, the organization had no filings for 2020 and raised just over $50,000 in 2018. Forman, like many on the medium, has made a number of inflammatory Tweets about President Trump and his supporters. He insinuated the president is a \u201cwould-be dictator\u201d and called his supporters deplorables. Raffensperger alleged that Vote Forward sent a letter to a deceased person encouraging them to vote. PRO-TRUMP ATTORNEYS SIDNEY POWELL, LIN WOOD URGE GEORGIANS NOT TO VOTE IN SENATE RUNOFFS WITHOUT CHANGES America Votes is a much larger operation, conducting voter education and mobilization efforts in 20 states. In his announcement, Raffensperger accused the progressive nonprofit of sending two absentee ballot applications in one week to an old address of a Georgia voter. During the 2020 election cycle, according to campaign finance data, the nonprofit amassed more than $15 million in donations. The group\u00a0dispersed money to a number of progressive political action committees. The investigation is a formal acknowledgement that there was some impropriety in the voting process, though both sides of the aisle understand it\u2019s nowhere near enough to upend Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state. Raffensperger\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News.

    "article_text": "Georgia Rep.-elect Carolyn Bourdeaux, only Democrat to flip seat, says party should talk to Trump supporters Georgia Rep.-elect Carolyn\u00a0Bourdeaux fell just 433 votes shy of becoming a congresswoman in 2018 in the tightest House\u00a0race in the country. But two years later, the college professor and public policy expert mounted a comeback by beating GOP emergency room physician\u00a0Rich McCormick by more than 10,000 votes and becoming the first woman to represent Georgia's 7th Congressional District. Her win in\u00a0November in\u00a0suburban Atlanta was a\u00a0major bright spot for House Democrats who otherwise had a tough 2020 election by losing unexpected seats and shrinking their majority. Bourdeaux arrived in Washington, D.C., recently for congressional orientation as the only Democrat to flip a red seat in earnest. Bourdeaux said the key for Democrats having future success will be to\u00a0listen to non-Democrats\u00a0as well. \"We need to pay a lot of attention to the\u00a0diverse communities of this country,\" Bourdeaux\u00a0told Fox News in an interview in\u00a0Washington, \"and that diversity includes people who supported Trump and people who are\u00a0not in our camp. One of the things I did over and over was just sit and listen to people.\" REP.-ELECT CARLOS GIMENEZ, FORMER MIAMI-DADE MAYOR, CONDEMNS OTHER MAYORS THAT 'ALLOWED MOB RULE' Democrats picked up two more open\u00a0House seats in North Carolina because of new congressional district maps. But\u00a0Bourdeaux remains the only Democrat to flip an existing red district blue. Meanwhile, Republicans flipped a dozen seats from blue to red and weakened the Democrats' majority. Bourdeaux credits her\u00a0win to putting in the work of building the Democratic Party infrastructure of registering voters, especially in the Asian American community, to the mobilizing efforts of\u00a0young organizers and meeting with people of all backgrounds. She said she visited mosques, synagogues and churches,\u00a0talked to the local Rotary Club, Chamber of Commerce\u00a0and Black fraternities and sororities to brainstorm solutions on issues important to them. She focused her campaign on universal messages of improving health care, fighting the coronavirus\u00a0and getting people back to work and school. \"It's a combination of message and then work,\" Bourdeaux said of her success in a traditionally Republican area of Georgia.\u00a0 The 2020 election delivered mixed results, with Joe Biden winning the White House and Georgia -- the first time a Democrat carried the Peach State since Bill Clinton in 1992. But Democrats lost seats in the House, and Biden's only hope of having Democrats control the Senate is by winning twin runoff elections on Jan. 5 in Georgia.\u00a0 REP.-ELECT LAUREN BOEBERT PLANS THANKSGIVING 'FUNERAL' FOR DEAD TURKEY IN DEFIANCE OF COLORADO GUIDELINES \"It was a double wave election where both sides really turned out in huge numbers,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said. \"I don't know if there's anything clear except that we are a purple nation.\u00a0... We're just going to have to find a way to focus on the problem and then work together to find a solution.\u201d Top of her list is\u00a0solving the coronavirus crisis and\u00a0improving health care.\u00a0It's\u00a0unacceptable that so many middle-class families are priced out of buying health care and those with insurance still can't afford to pay for prescription drugs or cover\u00a0their medical bills, she said. Health care problems hit close to home. Her\u00a0parents' health care costs become so expensive, they drained their bank accounts and couldn't afford to\u00a0pay for their medications. Bourdeaux's mother cared for her sick father for 10 years\u00a0until both her parents passed away in 2017, she said. \"I have my own personal story. My\u00a0father was sick for a decade. My mother took care of him and all of their discretionary income was eaten up paying for his prescription medications,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said. REP.-ELECT TONY GONZALES HELPS GOP HOLD TEXAS BORDER DISTRICT: 'MY STORY IS THE AMERICAN DREAM' In talking to a range of voters over the years, she saw that health care struggles are too common. \"I think everybody had a health care horror story,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said, relaying stories of maternity care and unexpected billing.\u00a0 \"I cannot believe we allow this to happen to us. And so those are the kind of things that we need to fix and ... I'm already talking to people about working in a bipartisan fashion.\" Growing up in Roanoke, Va., as the daughter of educators,\u00a0Bourdeaux earned admission to\u00a0Yale University where she got her\u00a0bachelor's degree\u00a0with the help of\u00a0grants and federal loans. She went on to receive a master's in public administration from the University of Southern California and a Ph.D. in public administration from Syracuse University. Bourdeaux, 50, is an associate professor at Georgia State University teaching classes centered on\u00a0public service, policy\u00a0and budgeting. She's a wife and mother to an 8-year-old son. ASHLEY HINSON, FORMER TV NEWS ANCHOR, IS LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS \u2014 NOT TO 'LAUNCH FIREBOMBS' IN CONGRESS She brings to Washington a deep policy expertise\u00a0that she wants to put to use to find bipartisan solutions, especially on health care. She previously\u00a0tackled legislative issues in Washington, D.C., as an aide to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and was the\u00a0former director of the nonpartisan Georgia Senate Budget Office where she worked with both parties to balance the budget during the Great Recession.\u00a0 \"I had solved problems during the last\u00a0worst crisis this country had faced and I had done it\u00a0in\u00a0a bipartisan basis. I got the job done for people,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said.\u00a0 In contrast to the Democratic socialist wing of the party, Bourdeaux takes a more measured approach to health care, policing, free college tuition and more. She wants to improve the Affordable Care Act and add\u00a0a public option but doesn't back \"Medicare for all.\" She didn't run on the Green New Deal; instead, she talks of having a Marshall Plan level of investment in clean-energy jobs and building up a green transit system. \"I'm very interested in ... having a big infrastructure investment,\" Bourdeaux said. \"We need it anyway. If\u00a0you've driven through Atlanta, we have soul-sucking commutes and horrific traffic.\" Bourdeaux thinks police departments may actually need more funding, not less, to support better\u00a0training and community policing programs.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I have never said defund the police,\" she said. \"That's just a made-up argument and it takes away from a very important conversation we need to be having about race.\" REP.-ELECT DIANA HARSHBARGER SAYS CONGRESS IS NO MATCH 'FOR A WOMAN WHO CAN MULTITASK' As a college professor, Bourdeaux understands firsthand the struggles students face trying to pay\u00a0for school but says families\u00a0need to have some skin in the game.\u00a0\"I believe in affordable. I don't know that I can get you to free.\" When she recently arrived in Washington, D.C., Bourdeaux\u00a0took stock of her\u00a0historic victory. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It's\u00a0an extraordinary honor to be here and to go step on the House floor where so many historic debates have taken place,\" Bourdeaux said.\u00a0\"I don't think you run for an office like that unless you really deeply believe in the country. You see the Capitol building and you're like: 'I\u00a0can't believe\u00a0I'm going to have the privilege of working there.' It truly is very, very moving.\"",

He\u00a0said his office's 23 investigators are also continuing\u00a0to look into allegations of problems with absentee ballots, as well as claims of people who voted twice, people who cast a ballot in a dead person's name, and non-residents who voted in Georgia. Gabriel Sterling, a top official in Raffensperger's office, said more than 250 cases have been opened, but there has been nothing so far that jumps out as being likely to change the outcome of the election.  Raffensperger\u00a0also hit back at allegations of widespread fraud, saying those that perpetuate them \u201care exploiting the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation and, frankly, they're misleading the president as well, apparently.\u201d  DISTRICT JUDGE HALTS 3 GEORGIA COUNTIES FROM ERASING DOMINION VOTING MACHINE DATA The secretary of state's office is looking into a sworn statement from a Republican official in Gwinnett County, in Atlanta's northeastern suburbs, that says there were more absentee ballots than absentee ballot envelopes, Raffensperger said. \"This is the kind of specific charge that our office can investigate and ascertain the truth,\" he said. County election workers around the state are currently working on a recount of the presidential race that was requested by the Trump campaign, and Raffensperger said he expects them to finish by the Wednesday night deadline. Under state law, the losing candidate can request a recount when the margin is less than 0.5%. Certified results showed Trump losing to Biden by 12,670 votes, or 0.25%. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The recount, which is being done using scanners that read and tabulate votes, is the third time the votes in the presidential race are being counted in Georgia. After the initial count following Election Day, Raffensperger selected the presidential race for an audit required by state law. Because of the tight margin, he said, the audit required the roughly 5 million votes in that contest to be recounted by hand. The Associated Press contributed to this report. ",

    "article_text": "Trump presses 'hapless' Georgia governor to overrule secretary of state on signature matching President Trump called on Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to override Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on matching signatures during the state's recount, in a tweet Monday. Raffensperger has said that matching the signature on the outer envelope to the absentee ballot on the inside is impossible, because the ballots are separated from the envelopes when they are opened to protect voter privacy. The Trump campaign, which formally asked for a recount Nov. 22, says that \"without signature-matching, this recount would be a sham and again allow for illegal votes to be counted.\" Georgia certified President-elect Joe Biden as the winner on Nov. 20. \"Why won\u2019t Governor\u00a0@BrianKempGA, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes,\" Trump tweeted Monday. \"It will be a 'goldmine'\u00a0of fraud, and we will easily WIN the state.\" \"Also, quickly check the number of envelopes versus the number of ballots,\" he continued. \"You may just find that there are many more ballots than there are envelopes. So simple, and so easy to do. Georgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done!\" JUDGE HALTS 3 ATLANTA-AREA COUNTIES FROM ERASING DOMINION VOTING MACHINE DATA The tweets come a day after Trump told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that he is \"ashamed\" he endorsed Kemp during his 2018 race against Democrat Stacey Abrams. Georgia Sens. Kelly Loeffler\u00a0and David Perdue, two Republicans involved in runoff races, have backed the president's signature-matching demands and\u00a0called\u00a0for Raffensperger's resignation. But emergency rules that were adopted ahead of the presidential election explicitly require,\u00a0in order to\u00a0preserve the secrecy of each individual vote as laid out in Georgia law and the\u00a0Georgia Constitution, that ballots be separated from\u00a0their envelopes so\u00a0they cannot possibly be joined back together. GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE SOUNDS ALARM AHEAD OF RUNOFF ELECTIONS An emergency rule that was\u00a0adopted earlier this year\u00a0mandates that every absentee ballot goes through signature verification but that after the signature is verified the ballot itself is separated from the outer envelope with the signature. After the Trump criticism, Raffensperger said Monday that \"dishonest actors\" are spreading \"massive amounts of misinformation.\" \"There are those who are exploiting the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation, and frankly they are misleading the president as well apparently,\" he said during a Monday statement to reporters. \"We will continue to investigation credible claims of illegal voting and violation of state election law,\" he continued. \"There are currently over 250 open cases from 2020 and we have 23 investigators to follow up on that.\" In a Monday letter, the Trump campaign again asked Raffensperger to audit the signatures on absentee ballots and envelopes in all Georgia counties.

The deadline to complete the recount is Dec. 2. \u00a0 Joe Biden defeated President Trump\u00a0by about 13,000\u00a0votes\u00a0in the Peach State, but Trump and his legal team have challenged the results. Trump has expressed frustration with state leaders over how both the\u00a0election and vote count were handled and has been\u00a0vocal in his criticism of top Republicans in the state. Trump told Fox News on Sunday that Gov. Brian Kemp has done \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d to question the results and\u00a0has\u00a0also called Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d for allowing what he called\u00a0a \u201cfraudulent system\u201d to persist\u00a0in the state. Raffensperger certified the election result on Nov. 20, and Kemp signed off on it. WSB-TV pointed\u00a0to an op-ed that Raffensperger wrote last week where he said the election seemed as though it was \u201cwildly successful\u201d and \"smooth.\u201d \u201cThis should be something for Georgians to celebrate, whether their favored presidential candidate won or lost.

Trump and his supporters have insisted that he won the election and it is only due to widespread fraud that Biden was declared the winner. Trump's critics say he clearly lost and has yet to provide evidence to suggest the contrary.\u00a0 Trump said in an interview Sunday that his Department of Justice has been \u201cmissing in action.\u201d\u00a0He also questioned the whereabouts\u00a0of the FBI. \u201cYou would think if you\u2019re in the FBI or Department of Justice, this is the biggest thing you could be looking at.

Last week, Michael Steel, a spokesman for Dominion denied claims that vote cast through the company\u2019s systems were at risk of being altered. He said it is physically impossible to alter votes in the system. DERSHOWITZ: TRUMP HAS 'CONSTITUTIONAL PATHS' TO PURSUE IN COURT CASES, WILL LIKELY COME UP SHORT \"Look, when a voter votes on a Dominion machine, they fill out a ballot on a touch screen. They are given a printed copy which they then give to a local election official for safekeeping. If any electronic interference had taken place, the tally reported electronically would not match the printed ballots. and in every case where we've looked\u00a0at -- in Georgia, all across the country -- the printed ballot, the gold standard in election security, has matched the electronic tally,\"\u00a0he said.
