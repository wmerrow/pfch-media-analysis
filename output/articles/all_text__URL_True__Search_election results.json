    "org_text": "Trump Has Discussed With Advisers Pardons for His 3 Eldest Children and Giuliani President Trump has discussed with advisers whether to grant pre-emptive pardons to his children, to his son-in-law and to his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and talked with Mr. Giuliani about pardoning him as recently as last week, according to two people briefed on the matter. Mr. Trump has told others that he is concerned that a Biden Justice Department might seek retribution against the president by targeting the oldest three of his five children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump \u2014 as well as Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, a White House senior adviser. Donald Trump Jr. had been under investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, for contacts that the younger Mr. Trump had had with Russians offering damaging information on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign, but he was never charged. Mr. Kushner provided false information to federal authorities about his contacts with foreigners for his security clearance, but was given one anyway by the president. The nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s concern about any potential criminal exposure of Eric Trump or Ivanka Trump is unclear, although an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney into the Trump Organization has expanded to include tax write-offs on millions of dollars in consulting fees by the company, some of which appear to have gone to Ms. Trump. Presidential pardons, however, do not provide protection against state or local crimes. Mr. Giuliani\u2019s potential criminal exposure is also unclear, although he was under investigation as recently as this summer by federal prosecutors in Manhattan for his business dealings in Ukraine and his role in ousting the American ambassador there. The plot was at the heart of the impeachment of Mr. Trump. The speculation about pardon activity at the White House is churning furiously, underscoring how much the Trump administration has been dominated by investigations and criminal prosecutions of people in the president\u2019s orbit. Mr. Trump himself was singled out by federal prosecutors as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d in a court filing in the case that sent Michael D. Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, to prison. The discussions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani occurred as the former New York mayor has become one of the loudest voices pushing baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, which Mr. Trump still proclaims publicly that he won. Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime aides have refused to do his bidding to try to overturn an election that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. won by nearly seven million votes. But Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly thrust himself into the spotlight to cast doubt on the results, which has ingratiated him with the president. ABC News reported earlier on Tuesday that Mr. Trump was considering pardoning family members. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment. Mr. Giuliani did not respond to a message seeking comment, but after a version of this article was published online, he attacked it on Twitter and said it was false. Christiann\u00e9 L. Allen, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s spokeswoman, said Mr. Giuliani \u201ccannot comment on any discussions that he has with his client.\u201d And Mr. Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Robert Costello, said, \u201cHe\u2019s not concerned about this investigation because he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and that\u2019s been our position from Day 1.\u201d The Fox News host and Trump ally Sean Hannity said on Monday that given the animosity from Democrats directed at Mr. Trump, the president should consider pardoning his entire family. \u201cIf Biden ever became president, I\u2019d tell Trump pardon yourself and pardon your family,\u201d Mr. Hannity told his viewers. Mr. Trump is an avid consumer of Fox News, particularly Mr. Hannity\u2019s show. Such a broad pardon pre-empting any charge or conviction is highly unusual but does have precedent. In the most famous example, President Gerald R. Ford pardoned Richard M. Nixon for all of his actions as president. President George Washington pardoned plotters of the Whiskey Rebellion, shielding them from treason prosecutions. And President Jimmy Carter pardoned thousands of American men who illegally avoided the draft for the Vietnam War. Mr. Trump has wielded his clemency powers liberally in cases that resonate with him personally or for people who have a direct line to him through friends or family, while thousands of other cases await his review. A pardon for Mr. Giuliani is certain to prompt accusations that Mr. Trump has used his pardon power to obstruct investigations and insulate himself and his allies. Andrew A. Weissmann, a top prosecutor for Mr. Mueller, has said that Mr. Trump\u2019s dangling of pardons for his allies impeded their work. In July, the president commuted the sentence of his longtime adviser Roger J. Stone Jr., who had refused to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s investigators and was eventually convicted of seven felonies. Last week, Mr. Trump pardoned his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, who had backed out of his cooperation agreement with the special counsel\u2019s office for \u201cany and all possible offenses\u201d beyond the charge he had faced of lying to federal investigators. The Flynn pardon raised expectations that Mr. Trump would bestow clemency on other associates \u2014 like his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who refused to discuss matters from the 2016 election with prosecutors \u2014 in his final weeks in office. Mr. Giuliani has asked Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to pay him $20,000 a day for his work on trying to overturn the election, a figure that would make him among the most highly paid lawyers in the world. The staggering sum has stirred opposition among Mr. Trump\u2019s aides who worry that Mr. Giuliani has perpetuated the claims of election fraud in hopes of making as much money as possible. Mr. Giuliani has expressed concern that any federal investigations of his conduct that appear to have been dormant under the Trump administration could be revived in a Biden administration, according to people who have spoken to him. Legal experts say that if Mr. Trump wants to fully protect Mr. Giuliani from prosecution after he leaves office, the president would most likely have to detail in the language of the pardon what crimes he believed Mr. Giuliani had committed. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have since 2019 been investigating the role of Mr. Giuliani and two other associates in a wide-ranging pressure campaign directed at pushing the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, namely Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. President Trump\u00a0has discussed potential pardons\u00a0that could test the boundaries of his constitutional power to nullify criminal liability. Here\u2019s some clarity on his ability to pardon. The two Giuliani associates \u2014 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman \u2014 were arrested in October 2019 as they prepared to board a flight from Washington to Frankfurt with one-way tickets. They were charged with violating campaign finance laws as part of a complex scheme to undermine the former American ambassador in Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump believed should have been doing more to pressure the Ukrainians. Prosecutors in Manhattan continued to investigate Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role in the scheme over the past year, focusing on whether he was, in pushing to oust Ms. Yovanovitch, essentially double dipping: working not only for Mr. Trump but also for Ukrainian officials who wanted the ambassador gone for their own reasons, according to people briefed on the matter. It is a federal crime to try to influence the United States government at the request or direction of a foreign official without disclosing their involvement. Mr. Giuliani has said that he did nothing wrong and that he did not register as a foreign agent because he was acting on behalf of Mr. Trump, not any Ukrainians. Even as Mr. Trump maintains that the election was stolen and files lawsuits aimed at delaying its certification, his White House is preparing for the final stages of his presidency. The end of any administration typically prompts a wave of pardons, particularly when a term has been engulfed in controversy like Mr. Trump\u2019s, in which several people close to him became ensnared in federal investigations. \u201cThe pardon power has been used by many presidents in politically self-serving ways, whether it was George H.W. Bush or Clinton,\u201d said Jack L. Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School, citing how Mr. Bush pardoned six of his associates \u2014 including the former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger \u2014 for their role in the Iran-contra affair. \u201cPolitically, a pardon of Giuliani would be explosive,\u201d Mr. Goldsmith added, \u201cbut pardoning pals has been done before.\u201d Under previous administrations, presidents have largely granted pardons after they have gone through a formal review process at the Justice Department, where lawyers examined the convictions, discussed the ramifications of a potential pardon with prosecutors and then provided the White House with recommendations on how to proceed. On several occasions, Mr. Trump has gone against the Justice Department\u2019s recommendations and the advice of his own White House advisers, granting pardons to political allies and celebrities. When presidents have deviated from that process, scandals have occasionally occurred, especially after pardons in the last days of an administration. On the final day of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, he granted a pardon to Marc Rich, a wealthy financier and longtime Democratic donor who was considered a fugitive as he had fled the United States to avoid tax charges. Prosecutors in Manhattan investigated whether the pardon had been part of a quid pro quo, but no one was ever charged. At the time, Mr. Giuliani, who had helped bring criminal charges against Mr. Rich years earlier as a federal prosecutor, was deeply critical of the move, calling it \u201ca disgrace\u201d and declaring it \u201ca midnight pardon.\u201d No president has tried to grant someone a pardon for crimes they have not yet committed \u2014 essentially a prospective get-out-of-jail-free card \u2014 and legal experts say it is unlikely to hold any weight. In the case of Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation examined questions of whether his contacts during the 2016 election with WikiLeaks and Russians offering dirt on Mrs. Clinton amounted to campaign finance violations. Donald Trump Jr. was never interviewed by the special counsel\u2019s office and was never charged. In the case of Mr. Kushner, he omitted several significant contacts with foreigners when he filled out a form for his White House security clearance, including ones with the Russians offering damaging information on Mrs. Clinton during the campaign. Under federal law it is a crime to provide inaccurate or incomplete information on the background check documents for security clearances. In 2018, the White House counsel and chief of staff recommended that Mr. Kushner not receive a Top Secret security clearance because of issues that had been discovered during his background check. Over the objections of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, the president unilaterally granted Mr. Kushner the clearance. Ben Protess contributed reporting."

    "org_text": "SNL\u2019s cold open spoofs Rudy Giuliani\u2019s absurd Michigan hearing In its December 5 cold open, Saturday Night Live parodied the testimony of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s roster of witnesses at a widely-panned hearing before Michigan lawmakers last week, in which President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer tried to convince legislators to overturn the state\u2019s election results. The sketch sought to mock the way in which many of the witnesses, in real life, rehashed baseless claims of voter fraud and misconduct, and on one particularly notable occasion, became adversarial toward the Michigan lawmakers overseeing the hearing while floating conspiracy theories. Kate McKinnon, playing a theatrical and bumbling Giuliani, opened the hearing by declaring, \u201cThis election was stolen from the American people with a level of trickery not seen since Houdini.\u201d When asked for evidence of his claims, McKinnon\u2019s Giuliani went on: \u201cI have brought before you a dozen highly intelligent, barely intoxicated individuals who are all eyewitnesses, and after hearing their testimony you\u2019re going to say, \u2018Wow, Rudy was right, and he\u2019s getting smarter and more respected every day.\u2019\u201d The first witness to offer their testimony was Cecily Strong playing Melissa Carone \u2014 a contract information technology worker for a voting systems company \u2014 who, in real life, made sweeping, evidence-free allegations about fraud at the hearing. \u201cI personally saw hundreds, if not thousands, of dead people vote for Democrats,\u201d Strong\u2019s Carone stated. \u201cDid you check every poll? Did you talk to all the dead people?\u201d  Heidi Gardner played another eyewitness, who claimed she saw Democrats serving ballots from food trucks. \u201cThe Democrats said, \u2018It\u2019s lunch time\u2019 and then they opened the food truck and it was full \u2014 full of ballot sandwiches, ballot pizzas, ballot steaks, and ballot spaghetti,\u201d she said.  Gardner\u2019s testimony seems to be an allusion to the real-life Carone\u2019s insinuations in an interview with Fox News\u2019s Lou Dobbs that venders providing food to poll workers were carrying fraudulent votes. Beck Bennett played My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell, a Trump ally who has made numerous implausible claims about voter fraud in recent weeks, and who, in SNL\u2019s version of events, used his testimony as a thinly veiled advertisement for his company. Alex Moffat played a witness who described an alien abduction story and then clarified that he saw the aliens \u201cclearly filling out absentee ballots, all of them for Biden.\u201d Asked when it happened, he said it was \u201cseven years ago.\u201d There was also an appearance by Pete Davidson and Kyle Mooney playing two of the 14 men accused of a militia plot which included kidnapping Michigan\u2019s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, saying that they needed a chance \u201cto do the whole thing over again.\u201d \u201cIf we have one more shot, we can get her in my basement for sure!\u201d Davidson shouted. McKinnon\u2019s Giuliani wrapped up the hearing with a nod to the personal interests of those involved with keeping up Trump\u2019s quixotic legal efforts to contest the election results: \u201cThe defense rests, but we will never rest, not until this election is overturned, or unless I get a full pardon or $10 million in cash.\u201d    Rudy Giuliani\u2019s bizarre legal strategy, in two clips  \u201cWhat\u2019d you guys do \u2014 take it and do something crazy to it?\u201d That\u2019s just one of many absurd claims in a clip that has reached more than 13 million views already, where Melissa Carone \u2014 one of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s star witnesses at a hearing where he asked Michigan legislators to overturn the state\u2019s presidential election results \u2014 veers from accusation to accusation. In a testy exchange, Carone accuses Republican state representatives of tampering with state voting records when one official tells her the poll book is not off by 30,000 votes.  The exchange is comically hard to follow, but it\u2019s illustrative of the sputtering, slapdash, and conspiracy theory-driven nature of Trumpworld\u2019s flailing attempts to discredit and overturn the results of the 2020 election. Carone\u2019s testimony was part of a hearing scheduled on December 1 when Michigan House Oversight Chair Matt Hall (R) invited Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to \u201cspeak to the committee on election irregularities in Michigan.\u201d Hall said in his statement that he was hoping for \u201cclarity and transparency.\u201d  That\u2019s not what Michigan got.  According to MLive, the Trump legal team mostly spent their time calling up Michigan Republicans to testify against the election process in Wayne County. Many of them rehashed baseless claims of voter fraud and misconduct \u201cmade at a Senate Oversight Committee hearing Tuesday and in affidavits included in various legal challenges to the election results ... none of those challenges have been successful in court.\u201d This hearing came two days after Attorney General Bill Barr told the Associated Press that there was no proof that widespread voter fraud could have altered the result of the 2020 presidential election. Michigan Republicans did not allow testimony under oath, restricted Democrats from calling witnesses, and prohibited cross-examination, leading Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to call the hearings a \u201cstate sponsored disinformation campaign geared toward undermining our electoral system.\u201d Carone\u2019s testimony was, if not emblematic, at least fairly in step with the rest of the hearing. Her testimony went too far for even Giuliani, who at one point leaned over, seemingly to try to restrain his witness after she laughed derisively at a request to stop interrupting the official asking her to clarify her claims of fraud. It\u2019s unclear what Giuliani expected \u2014 Carone\u2019s accusations had been aired on Fox when she was interviewed on November 11. In the interview with Lou Dobbs, she insinuated that vans providing food to poll workers were in fact carrying illegitimate votes instead. Days later, a Wayne County judge stated that these allegations \u201csimply are not credible,\u201d according to reporting by the Washington Post.  Multiple witnesses focused their criticisms on Detroit, a city that is 79 percent Black and that Giuliani referred to as \u201ccorrupt,\u201d saying \u201cdon\u2019t scratch your head about what happens in Detroit. They steal elections in Detroit.\u201d  MLive reported that Detroit activists have been alarmed by the Trump campaign\u2019s claims of voter fraud in their city. Activist Branden Snyder told MLive that it \u201creeks of racism ... that Black folks and in a majority-Black city can\u2019t count their own votes.\u201d Nessel echoed these claims, saying \u201cthe themes we see, that persist here, are this: Black people are corrupt, Black people are incompetent, and Black people can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, one Michigan woman used racist language to argue in favor of instituting a voter ID requirement.  Accusations of voter fraud are inextricable from the long history of restricting the right of people of color to vote. A January brief published by the Brennan Center for Justice explains: Of course, Michigan does have a voter ID requirement. You have to present a valid form of identification or sign an affidavit. In the November 2016 election, only around 18,000 people opted to sign an affidavit instead of providing identification, according to Bridge Michigan, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news source. President-elect Joe Biden received over 150,000 more votes than Trump in the state.  One Republican official\u2019s reaction to the hearing pretty much sums it up \u2014 state Rep. Aaron Miller castigated Giuliani, telling the Detroit News: \u201cHe made wild and broad partisan insults for several minutes that had nothing to do with the election, and it was frankly unacceptable, shameful, and pathetic and distracts from any evidence that we might hear. I\u2019m utterly embarrassed.\u201d Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the election result has sputtered out President Donald Trump still has not conceded his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden, but his bid to overturn the election results has sputtered out over the past week. The lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors. Trump is still, of course, trying his best to cast doubt on the results by making false claims of large-scale voter fraud. His latest gimmick is that his legal team is working with sympathetic Republican legislators in key states to hold press events touting supposed election irregularities. But no GOP-controlled legislature in a state Biden won seems to be making a serious push to overturn the result (a move that would entail many practical and legal obstacles). But the deadline in federal law for states to finalize their results is December 8 \u2014 Tuesday of next week. Then, the members of the Electoral College will meet (separately in each state) to cast their votes on December 14 \u2014 in just under two weeks. They are set to cast the votes that will officially make Biden the next president. And Trump has not yet been able to succeed in interfering with that process. There were six key swing states where Biden won by small margins, where Trump had hoped to interfere with the certification of results (certification is when a state makes its results official). Four of those six states \u2014 Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada \u2014 certified their results over the past week and a half, with Biden as the winner. The fifth and sixth, Arizona and Wisconsin, certified Biden\u2019s victory on Monday. Trump made political, procedural, and legal attempts to try and delay or interfere with these certifications, but these efforts have uniformly failed. Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, spurned the Trump team\u2019s attempts to get him to endorse fictitious claims of widespread voter fraud in the state. In Michigan, Trump allies\u2019 attempts to get two Republicans on the state board of canvassers to  block certification for similar reasons failed last week (one of them backed it).  In most of the other states, the key officials in charge of certifying results were Democrats, so Trump could only hope that a judge would step in and block certification. None have \u2014 so the Trump team\u2019s lawsuits flopped. Recounts have also failed to change the outcome. Wisconsin\u2019s recount of two counties has concluded, and Biden\u2019s lead of about 20,000 votes expanded by 87 votes. Georgia\u2019s new machine recount is still ongoing, but it isn\u2019t expected to change Biden\u2019s 12,000-vote lead since the ballots have already been audited by hand. After states certify their results, the next step in the process is that the electors are appointed. And this is key \u2014 the electors are the 538 people who compose the Electoral College and cast the votes that will officially determine the next president.  If Biden wins a state, he is entitled to have his chosen slate of people appointed as the electors for that state. But some Republicans have embraced the theory that the Constitution empowers state legislatures to ignore the outcome of the vote in their states and appoint whoever they want as electors instead.  Any effort to do this would run afoul of various state laws and arguably federal law as well. Legislators would essentially be asserting that the power granted them by the Constitution allows them to ignore these existing laws.  Some GOP state legislators have indeed come out in support of this, such as Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano (who met with Trump last week before abruptly leaving the meeting after he was informed he had tested positive for Covid-19). But GOP state legislative leaders have not come out in support of this effort, and most have outright said they won\u2019t. Pennsylvania\u2019s legislative leaders have no plans to put this on their legislative agenda. And Michigan\u2019s Republican leaders left a meeting with Trump earlier this month and said they would \u201cfollow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan\u2019s electors.\u201d And even though Trump\u2019s legal team worked with allied legislators in Pennsylvania and Arizona to hold purported \u201chearings\u201d about election irregularities in recent days, those weren\u2019t official legislative hearings \u2014 they were essentially press stunts.  So with neither the officials in charge of certifications nor Republican state legislative leaders willing to try to steal the election for Trump, it looks like the president\u2019s attempt to do just that is dead in the water.

So with neither the officials in charge of certifications nor Republican state legislative leaders willing to try to steal the election for Trump, it looks like the president\u2019s attempt to do just that is dead in the water.  What happened to Democrats in North Carolina: \u201cIt was a total effort that failed down ballot\u201d North Carolina Democrats and progressive organizers this year had hoped for a repeat of the 2008 election, when Democrats won in the state up and down the ballot. Instead, they saw several victories for Republicans. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win the presidency,\u201d said Robert Dawkins, the political director of Action NC, an advocacy group focused on anti-poverty initiatives and voter outreach. \u201cWe didn\u2019t gain any progressive seats in the House, state Senate; most of the black candidates that ran for judges didn\u2019t win. It was a total effort that failed down ballot.\u201d Ahead of Election Day, polls projected positive results for Democrats in North Carolina \u2014 on November 3, President-elect Joe Biden led President Donald Trump in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s state polling average by 1.8 percentage points, Democratic US Senate candidate Cal Cunningham led incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis by anywhere from 2 to 6 percentage points, and incumbent Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper was regularly recorded as having double-digit support. Of the three, only Cooper won, and by 4.52 percentage points. Biden lost by 1.34 percentage points, Cunningham by 1.74 percentage points, and Republicans maintained control of the state legislature. The losses for Democrats weren\u2019t due to low turnout; in fact, turnout was up, with 75 percent of eligible voters \u2014 5.54 million people \u2014 casting ballots. According to the North Carolina state board of elections, Democrats expanded their voter base by nearly 500,000 compared to 2016, while Republicans gained about 400,000 more voters. And a Carolina Population Center analysis found about 1.8 million new voters (Democratic, Republican, and unaffiliated) registered compared to 2016. There was expanded access to polling sites, with early voting locations being added in cities and efforts to facilitate transportation for those lacking it on Election Day. A number of activists told me there were fewer instances of outright voter suppression than had been feared, and that wait times to cast ballots generally weren\u2019t long.  None of that was enough, however. Many I spoke to in the state said they believe the results showed the problem was not about enthusiasm or turnout, but about strategy, difficulty overcoming the consequences of past elections, and, most importantly, timing.  Unlike North Carolina, Biden was able to win in Georgia, defeating Trump by 0.25 percentage points. According to activists and organizers in North Carolina, the difference between the two states was at least partly self-inflicted. Take Democrats\u2019 outreach strategy in each state: Dawkins said Georgia deftly implemented a policy-centric approach that could have been employed more effectively in North Carolina. \u201cIn Georgia, from the start of the new year in January, everything, every campaign, if they were talking about why a neighborhood needs a speed bump, it was, \u2018It\u2019s not going to change until you register to vote. And here\u2019s a card, register to vote,\u2019\u201d Dawkins said. \u201cIt was surgical.\u201d A similar strategy led to Democrats\u2019 last big win in North Carolina in 2008, according to Dawkins. That year, the Democratic Party won the presidency, a US Senate race, the governor\u2019s chair, and maintained control of the state\u2019s General Assembly.  Dawkins said that year, \u201cI don\u2019t care if we\u2019re talking about a pothole, or I don\u2019t care if we\u2019re talking about the light rail here, or whatever it was, got tied to, \u2018And we need to vote to get this man in office.\u2019\u201d That year, Barack Obama was on the ballot, and this method of winning votes was made easier by the enthusiasm created by his candidacy. This time, voters weren\u2019t quite as animated by their choices.  Ahead of the election, Kevin Jones, the first vice chair of the Nash County Democratic Party, told me he was concerned about the level of enthusiasm for the Democrats on the ballot, particularly Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf Donald Trump needs 15 electoral votes to win the presidency and it comes down to one vote in North Carolina, it won\u2019t be my vote that gets him in there. But, you know, I don\u2019t feel too good about it.\u201d But there remains a sense that a different strategy could have overcome that gap. Obama wasn\u2019t on the ballot in Georgia this year either, and the state nevertheless flipped blue for the first time in nearly 30 years. Bennett Carpenter, the lead organizer for the progressive political group Durham for All, said his organization worked to highlight how Democratic policies would help voters \u2014 and saw success with it.  \u201cPeople are so clear, especially in this moment, on the issues facing our communities, they\u2019re loud and obvious,\u201d Carpenter said. Acknowledging that many in their community are frustrated with a lack of progress on those issues, Carpenter added that Durham for All saw success in \u201csharing messaging around, \u2018We can make change happen, we can work together\u2019 ... it\u2019s a bridge to bring people over kind of the arc from disillusionment to hope and possibility.\u201d  But Dawkins believes it should have been executed more broadly. Marcus Bass, the executive director of Advance Carolina, a progressive advocacy group focused on empowering Black communities, said he saw the problem as coming from the top. He believes that the national Democratic Party\u2019s \u201coffering of the Trump-or-else ticket, without really providing a deep response to some of these longstanding issues, hurt the efforts of turnout in North Carolina.\u201d  And Todd Zimmer, co-director of the rural progressive advocacy group Down Home North Carolina, noted that Democrats\u2019 single statewide success, the reelection of Gov. Roy Cooper, can be seen as a testament to the effectiveness of a policy-centric approach.  \u201cCooper has shown that he will fight for Medicaid expansion, that he\u2019ll stand up, even if he can\u2019t win that fight with a divided General Assembly,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI think he was rewarded by North Carolina voters because he\u2019s seen as someone who understands how important that issue is ... [and] his response also surely helped. Because North Carolinians approve of his handling of the coronavirus and oppose the reopen movement, by and large.\u201d A number of organizers also said Democrats hurt themselves. Organizers in many swing states have complained post-election that the Democratic Party relied too heavily on consultants and operatives from outside their states \u2014 and I heard similar lamentations about the national party\u2019s strategy in North Carolina.  Bass argued party leaders miscalculated in hoping the top of the ticket would buoy down-ballot candidates. And while national leaders were generally given credit for investing in the state, North Carolina organizers said that money was often not used wisely and that staff and consultants arrived too late in the year, with too little understanding of the communities they\u2019d been embedded in to do much good.  The issue, they said, and as Florida state Sen. Annette Taddeo told Politico, is that \u201cyou can\u2019t just show up a month before the election and expect people to be excited to vote for you.\u201d  Perhaps the most important issue was one of time, according to many organizers. They said flipping North Carolina can and will happen, once they\u2019ve had a few more years to do so. Durham for All was limited in part by being a relatively new organization, Carpenter said \u2014 it was founded only four years ago. Down Home North Carolina is about three years old. And many of the progressive organizations they partner with are around the same age or newer. \u201cIn the places where we\u2019re really building that infrastructure, I think we\u2019re seeing real gains,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cA lesson to me is that that infrastructure takes time and resources and permanent year-round work.\u201d Carpenter said the hope is that in four years, with continued work and engagement, the results of North Carolina\u2019s elections will be radically different. And in Georgia, organizers told me that time \u2014 coupled with consistent work \u2014 was the secret to their success. Deborah Scott, the executive director of Georgia Stand-Up told Vox\u2019s Anna North that turning Georgia blue was a 15-year effort.  As Lewanna Heard-Tucker, chair of Georgia\u2019s Fulton County Democrats, told me, \u201cAt the end of the day, this has been a long time coming for Georgia. It didn\u2019t just happen overnight.\u201d While there are certainly opportunities Democrats and organizers can continue to pursue, their efforts were also complicated by factors outside of their control. Chief among these was the coronavirus pandemic, which forced organizers and party officials to scrap their plans for registration and motivation and to hastily come up with new strategies.  \u201cRight when we started [outreach efforts] Covid hit, which threw a wrench in some of our plans, particularly because our initial plan had been really focused on door-knocking as the way that you can really meet people where they\u2019re at and build relationships,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cAnd so right from jump, we had to really switch to primarily phone-banking and text-banking and from in-person events to virtual.\u201d For Durham for All, those efforts were more effective than they might have hoped. And Bass noted that while the pandemic made organizing difficult, it allowed Advance Carolina to engage in ways it might not otherwise have been able to. \u201cTaking us out of physical spaces,\u201d said Bass, \u201chelped build a broader base, in some cases, where groups that typically would just be meeting in private spaces now are online.\u201d But for other organizations, the transition was more difficult. Zimmer said Down Home North Carolina moved to a \u201crelational turnout model\u201d where about 800 leaders were given access to an app to help support them in outreach to friends, family, and others they had personal relationships with. The organization also moved an outreach strategy based around conversations on race and class it had planned to use in person to the phones.  \u201cI think that was to our disadvantage, frankly,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI think that those tactics are powerful and strong, but that doors is a really important part of our electoral process. And so I wish we could have a do-over and could be on doors.\u201d And Dawkins noted that many other organizations struggled as they \u201cdrastically moved off of a tried-and-true and proven method of door contact and phone-banking and switched over to more mobile mobilization work, which I don\u2019t think paid off.\u201d Much of that mobile mobilization work consisted of \u201cwhat we call souls to the polls,\u201d Dawkins said \u2014 meaning organizations worked with pastors and other community leaders to put together marches to polling places. \u201cThat drastically hurt,\u201d Dawkins told me, \u201cbecause what you found was the people that were showing up and taking part in these marches to the polls and souls to the polls were people that were already gonna vote.\u201d Because of pandemic- and funding-related challenges, Action NC was ultimately not able to match its normal level of voter engagement. \u201cNormally we shoot to register between 15,000 and 20,000 people a year. This year, we reregistered 6,500. So that was a big hit,\u201d Dawkins said. Still, statewide, registration was up, buoyed in part by the state\u2019s nearly 400,000 new residents since 2016. Turnout increased dramatically as well. In the rural communities Down Home North Carolina serves, Zimmer said, \u201cin a lot of cases [there was] an over 100 percent increase versus \u201916.\u201d Overall, Carpenter said, \u201cWe brought 100,000 more folks into the races than the right wing did, which meant that when it comes to statewide races, we were able to really narrow the gap \u2014 but still not close it.\u201d Closing that gap was complicated in part by the past. While Democrats won resoundingly in 2008, they lost badly in 2010, when Republicans took control of the North Carolina\u2019s General Assembly. These lawmakers oversaw redistricting after the 2010 census, redrawing maps to benefit the GOP \u2014 first along racial lines and then along partisan lines after their initial effort was invalidated by the US Supreme Court for diluting the voting power of Black North Carolinians. In 2012, a Republican governor won, giving the GOP complete control of the state. New voting constraints, including a voter ID law, followed in 2013. These were struck down in 2016 by the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals for targeting \u201cAfrican Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d A modified version of the voter ID law was then instated via ballot measure in 2018. It\u2019s currently being fought in court \u2014 and as a result, was not in effect for the 2020 election. Nevertheless, this reality made it feel as though Democrats and organizers for progressive causes were playing against a stacked deck, their voting power diluted and many citizens unsure of whether they had the documents needed to vote. Carpenter said it \u201cfor sure\u201d hurt Democrats in the most recent election.  Many organizers, like Carpenter, see the 2020 election as the catalyst for greater change in the state and the start of years of organizing work and court battles in order to make North Carolina more competitive for Democrats. Legal challenges to the state\u2019s voter ID law are set to continue in state and federal court \u2014 and advocates hope to lobby for greater access to voter registration. For example, online voter registration was made available this cycle for North Carolinians with driver\u2019s licenses, a policy change Carpenter called \u201can improvement that still didn\u2019t fully address the structural barriers that prevent particularly people of color, poor working-class people, and young people from registering and voting.\u201d Expanding that access would make registering new voters easier ahead of the 2022 races. Carpenter also spoke of working to expand Democrats\u2019 voter base. Biden was clearly able to grow his base of support in historically Democratic counties but struggled more to flip back Obama-voting counties Trump won in 2016. In many of those, Trump built upon his 2016 vote totals; for example, in Robeson County, which Trump swung by 21 percentage points in 2016, he beat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by 4 percentage points. In 2020, he defeated Biden there by 18.6 percentage points. \u201cIf I have a takeaway from this election, it\u2019s that we need to continue to do work to persuade people who might be voting for Trump that actually, our politics offers them a better path towards a more hopeful and prosperous and happier future,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI think we need to have the audacity to believe that our vision can be more powerful and more compelling than the siren call of white supremacy.\u201d Perhaps the most immediately pressing issue for organizers and Democrats will be the fact that the GOP will retain control of the General Assembly.  When the new districts are drawn following the release of the 2020 census results, Republican lawmakers are likely to attempt to neutralize Democratic power in places where Biden significantly increased his vote share over Clinton, like Wake County, and to minimize the role new Democratic state residents have on elections. Dawkins said he and other activists expect to \u201cgo back to court and fight over that.\u201d  That means in the short term, organizers and local Democratic officials need to play where they can win, Carpenter said, adding that the key question is, \u201cHow can we actually be mobilizing for real change in the places where we do have decisive governing power as we\u2019re continuing to build that grassroots infrastructure at the local level?\u201d And in the long term, Zimmer said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conversations happening in some of the spaces I\u2019m in right now about 10-year strategies because there\u2019s a sense that North Carolina will change but that we have to organize and build strategically in order to get there.\u201d For many I spoke to, that strategic building will involve outreach, education, pooling resources with like-minded organizations, and the careful recruitment of candidates that reflect the communities they are running in and that have a nuanced grasp of policy.  The ultimate goal, Carpenter said, is to be in a position \u201cfour years from now, eight years from now, where we\u2019re continuing to grow the movement, grow the leaders, grow the infrastructure that can not just win one election, but actually continue to win real change for North Carolina.\u201d "

    "org_text": "Kemp, Trump clash over election results Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, pushed back on President Trump\u2019s demands for\u00a0\u201csignature verification\u201d in an attempt to overturn election\u00a0results, saying he has called for such an audit three times. After Kemp and the president reportedly spoke Saturday morning, the Georgia governor reminded\u00a0Trump of their conversation. Trump took to Twitter to voice his frustration over losing the traditionally red state by 12,500 votes and said, \u201cI will easily & quickly win Georgia if Governor [Kemp] or the Secretary of State permit a simple signature verification.\u201d \u201cHas not been done and will show large scale discrepancies,\u201d Trump claimed. \u201cWhy are these two \u2018Republicans\u2019 saying no? If we win Georgia, everything else falls in place!\u201d But the president\u2019s Saturday comments did not line up with what Kemp reportedly told Trump. \u201cAs I told the President this morning, I\u2019ve publicly called for a signature audit three times (11/20, 11/24, 12/3) to restore confidence in our election process and to ensure that only legal votes are counted in Georgia,\u201d Kemp fired back on Twitter, directly responding to Trump\u2019s tweet. Trump later responded asking that the governor call for a \"special session of the legislature,\" calling the governing body together outside of the normal session periods. \"But you never got the signature verification! Your people are refusing to do what you ask,\" Trump replied on twitter.\u00a0\"What are they hiding? At least immediately ask for a Special Session of the Legislature. That you can easily, and immediately, do.\" Georgia officials\u00a0completed a hand recount of the votes along with an additional machine-based recount, both of which found\u00a0President-elect Joe Biden had won Georgia. But even if Trump did win Georgia, it would not be enough for reelection. Biden\u00a0already secured 279 Electoral College votes after California certified its results Friday. There still are three other\u00a0states -- Colorado, Hawaii and New Jersey \u2013 that Biden won but that have not yet certified votes. NEVADA GOP VOWS APPEAL AFTER JUDGE DISMISSES TRUMP CAMPAIGN\u2019S LATEST SUIT Biden is expected to be elected with 306 Electoral College votes to Trump\u2019s 232 votes. Friday, the Trump campaign filed another lawsuit in Georgia requesting the state courts\u00a0\u201corder a new election to be conducted in the presidential race,\u201d alleging \u201ctens of thousands of illegal votes.\u201d The Trump campaign\u2019s legal team has\u00a0issued dozens of lawsuits in several states claiming voter and election fraud \u2013 none of which have held up. \u201cWhat was filed today clearly documents that there are literally tens of thousands of illegal votes that were cast, counted, and included in the tabulations the Secretary of State is preparing to certify,\u201d Ray S. Smith III, attorney for the Trump campaign, said in the statement Friday.\u00a0\u201cThe Secretary of State has orchestrated the worst excuse for an election in Georgia history.\u201d \u201cWe are asking the Court to vacate the certification of the presidential election and to order a new statewide election for president,\u201d Smith added. Kemp is not the only Republican pushing back on Trump\u2019s repeated claims of fraud. Numerous investigations\u00a0have found no evidence of widespread fraud. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, dismissed\u00a0accusations of election fraud due to lack of evidence, and condemned Trump\u2019s \u201cviolent rhetoric.\u201d \u201cEven after this office's request that President Trump try and quell the violent rhetoric being born out of his continuing claims of winning the states where he obviously lost, he tweeted out \u2018expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia,\u2019\u201d Raffensperger said earlier this week during a press conference, reported Reuters.

The Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections adjourned a meeting Friday in which members voted to recertify the results of the 2020 presidential race in favor of President-elect Joe Biden in a 3-2 voice vote. Much of the meeting focused on a video that went viral Thursday, which political commentators claimed showed Fulton County election officials illegally stuffing ballots -- a form of election fraud in which more ballots are counted than were cast by eligible voters in a specific location. A senior source in Raffensperger's office\u00a0told\u00a0Fox\u00a0News that the video has\u00a0been investigated and claims that it showed ballot fraud deemed unfounded, adding that Fulton County election officials had a designated observer at the location the entire time -- a practice that has been in place since June. Raffensperger's office\u00a0also debunked allegations that the ballots were stuffed in\u00a0a pair of \"suitcases\" that one election official pulled out from beneath a table in the video, saying footage shows the ballots in the cases that they were supposed to be kept in.\u00a0 HANNITY ON SUSPICIOUS SUITCASE VIDEO Republican Georgia Rep. Jody Hice, however, shared the video on Twitter, calling the footage \"explosive fraud.\" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said during a Thursday interview on \"The Ingraham Angle\"\u00a0that\u00a0he has called for a signature audit into the video, but only the secretary of state has the power to order one. COLLINS IMPLORES GOP VOTERS TO TURN OUT FOR GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS: 'PEOPLE CANNOT GIVE UP ON THE SYSTEM' Georgia\u00a0election chief Gabe Sterling shared a fact-check article from a news outlet called Lead Stories in a Thursday tweet, saying, \"The 90-second video of election workers at State Farm arena, purporting to show fraud was watched in its entirety (hours) by\u00a0@GaSecofState investigators. Shows normal ballot processing. Here is the fact check on it.\" Fulton County Elections Director Richard Barron told the Board of Registration and Elections during Friday's hearing that he had not seen the video, but his staff told him the footage showed \"normal\" activity. Barron took questions from\u00a0Republican board members Kathleen Ruth and\u00a0Mark Wingate, who voted against certifying election results. In response to claims that staff and media left the counting site early, Barron said no one was told to leave early and that certain staff left after their duties concluded. Democratic board member Aaron Johnson said\u00a0the board needs to\u00a0\"sit down, look at what actually happened\" and do what they can to\u00a0\"find out what happened.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The deadline for all counties to complete their recounts was midnight Wednesday. Raffensperger\u00a0told \u201cYour World with Neil Cavuto\u201d in November that he expected\u00a0to see \"very similar\" results. \u201cWhen we did the first audit, we found mistakes in three counties and that added over 1,000 votes for President Trump,\" Raffensperger said.\u00a0\"That has all been accounted for, and so I think this one will be very close to what we just have now. I don\u2019t see much difference whatsoever.\u201d President Trump has criticized Raffensperger\u2019s oversight of the election, while Georgia Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both up for reelection in the January runoffs, have called for his resignation.Alabama Rep-elect Barry Moore pledges to join challenge to electoral votes 'day one,' backs federal voter ID WASHINGTON \u2013 When Congressman-elect\u00a0Barry Moore enters Congress early next year, he plans immediately to join the fight to keep President Trump in office, challenging Electoral College votes with Rep. Mo Brooks, a fellow Alabama Republican. Moore, a former state legislator who staked a claim as the first elected official in the U.S. to endorse Trump in 2015, has been very active on social media in supporting the president's legal challenges to the election results and refusal to concede. And, in an interview with Fox News this week, he emphasized a desire to address \"election integrity\" in Congress \"regardless of who wins the election.\" \"We got to get it right. We got to make sure that either 70 or 80 million people don't feel disenfranchised and feel like it was stolen, regardless of which direction it goes,\" Moore said. \"You don't need to have somebody over here voting that's not necessarily legal or even it's not, they don't even exist. They just duplicate ballots and cancel you out or cancel me out.\" TRUMP THANKS\u00a0ALABAMA CONGRESSMAN WHO SAYS HE WILL CHALLENGE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES Moore added: \"We're governed by the consent of the people... and their consent is their vote and they consent to give us power. What if that power is not transferred ethically? Then it's an illegitimate election.\" Soon after the interview, Moore announced on social media he would support the Brooks challenge to the electoral votes. His office confirmed his intent. \"It\u2019s my honor to stand with @RepMoBrooks we met in his office yesterday it\u2019s time to stand it\u2019s time we draw a line I. The sand and advance #ElectionIntegrity ...it\u2019s the new #woke,\" Moore tweeted\u00a0Thursday.\u00a0He added that he would take up the election fight \"day one.\" Brooks, in an interview with \"Fox Across America,\" said he believed that state election laws on mail ballots were unconstitutional and that Congress should not be recognizing those votes.\u00a0 \"I, as a member of Congress and one of the judges and jurors that have the final and ultimate decision on who won this presidential election,\u00a0I'm not counting those ballots when I make a judgment as to whether a state submission of Electoral College votes is correct or incorrect,\" Brooks said.\u00a0\"I'm not counting any illegal ballots when I make that decision, and as such, in my judgment, if we limited our vote count to lawful votes cast by eligible American citizens, that\u00a0Donald Trump easily won a majority of the Electoral College and won reelection.\" TRUMP HINTS AT 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN WHITE HOUSE COMMENTS Moore is not the only incoming member to support Brooks. The highly controversial Congresswoman-elect Marjorie Taylor-Greene, R-Ga., has also said that she will support Brooks in challenging the Electoral College votes.\u00a0 The claim that the implementation of mail-in voting by states is unconstitutional has been\u00a0highly disputed.\u00a0In order to challenge an individual state\u2019s slate of electoral votes, a House and Senate member must both ask the bodies to debate and vote to accept or reject a state\u2019s electors. A state\u2019s electoral slate is tossed if both\u00a0the House and Senate then vote to reject it. That scenario is unlikely. Further,\u00a0allegations of\u00a0systemic voter fraud by the president and some of his allies have been largely unsubstantiated. Some lawsuits have challenged far fewer votes than the tens of thousands that Biden won by in key states. Others have included typos, factual errors or and more defects.\u00a0 Sweeping allegations of vote-switching by the voting software company Dominion, which some states used, also have not\u00a0been borne out, and judges routinely have ruled against suits brought by the Trump campaign and its allies. Attorney General Bill Barr said this week that his Justice Department\u00a0has not seen fraud on the kind of scale that could flip the election.\u00a0 FLORIDA REP.-ELECT KAT CAMMACK SHARES PERSONAL STORY ABOUT ABORTION: 'MY MOM CHOSE LIFE' \"To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,\" Barr told The Associated Press.\u00a0 Moore, though, said he would like Congress to address election security with federal legislation to ensure confidence and more uniformity. \"We passed the voter I.D. bill in Alabama, so when you go to vote, you show your I.D. and it's one person, one vote,\" Moore said. \"If another state\u00a0allows their constituents to cheat, then in many ways, these states that are doing it right are getting penalized for doing it right.\" He continued: \"There has to be a system, I think a national voter I.D., and I would be willing to fund the I.D. The federal government could put the funds, the money we spend in some areas... the American people have got to believe in the government that they've elected was duly elected by them.\" Moore mentioned that the federal government provides Americans with Social Security cards, and said a federal voter I.D. did not necessarily need to be a photo I.D., \"just the name lining up with the Social Security number when they vote.\" Moore added that he planned to speak with Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill to talk about how Alabama's elections were \"so smooth\" and how what can be learned from that state and apply on a national level.\u00a0 He also said he hoped to see\u00a0Barr investigate voter fraud claims more aggressively.\u00a0 REP.-ELECT CARLOS GIMENEZ, FORMER MIAMI DATE MAYOR, CONDEMNS OTHER MAYORS THAT 'ALLOWED MOB RULE' \"Barr says there's no evidence. How much time did you spend investigating?\" Moore said. \"I don't know. I don't want to be critical\u00a0of him because I think he's done a decent job in the past... How thorough of an investigation can you do in three weeks if it takes four years on collusion or two years on Ukraine or impeachment or whatever?\" The incoming congressman also said he considered himself a populist, which he defined as \"a movement in this nation which really wants the government to answer to its people... When [Trump] started bringing union people to support him and minority communities ... it said he cared about those people.\" Moore added: \"As a Republican, we need to help everybody... We can equal the starting line. We can't guarantee the outcome. People obviously have to make their own way in life.\" Moore, from a farming family,\u00a0represents a largely rural part of southeastern Alabama. His family has been farming peanuts and cotton. Moore himself started a garbage business, which, now a\u00a0member of Congress, he viewed\u00a0with pride and as evidence that the American Dream remained\u00a0possible. \"The one thing I tell my kids and I tell a lot of people is that the greatest thing in this nation we can give to the next generation is the freedom to excel in however they're created to do,\" Moore said. \"I started my garbage company driving the garbage truck, I started my company the ground up. I was the mechanic. I was the garbage truck driver, and I sit here before you today as a garbage man... in Congress and it's because those freedoms and the opportunities were afforded to me.\" He added: \"I don't know now that my son could do it.

Barr, during an interview with The Associated Press\u00a0Tuesday, said that U.S. attorneys and FBI officials have been working to follow up on specific complaints and information they have received, but have not uncovered enough\u00a0evidence that would change the outcome of the election. TRUMP CAMPAIGN FILES LAWSUIT IN WISCONSIN, ALLEGES 'ABUSE' OF ABSENTEE VOTING SYSTEM \u201cTo date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,\" Barr told The Associated Press. The DOJ on Tuesday attempted to clear up Barr's statement, with a spokesperson saying that a number of media outlets have \"incorrectly reported that the Department has concluded its investigation of election fraud.\" \u201cSome media outlets have incorrectly reported that the Department has concluded its investigation of election fraud and announced an affirmative finding of no fraud in the election,\" the spokesperson said.\u00a0\"That is not what the Associated Press reported nor what the Attorney General stated. The Department will continue to receive and vigorously pursue all specific and credible allegations of fraud as expeditiously as possible.\u201d Last month, Barr issued a directive to U.S. attorneys across the country allowing them to pursue any \u201csubstantial allegations\u201d of voting irregularities if they existed, before the results of the 2020 presidential race were certified. Barr\u2019s move gave prosecutors the ability to go around Justice Department policy that typically would prohibit investigations of the time before the election was certified. Soon after Barr\u2019s memo was issued, the Justice Department\u2019s top elections crime official announced he would step aside from that position. Barr'\u00a0interview comes two days after Trump told Fox News that the DOJ has been \"missing in action\" on possible election fraud.\u00a0Trump told \"Sunday Morning Futures\" Sunday that he has \u201cnot seen anything\u201d from the DOJ or FBI\u00a0on investigating the\u00a02020 election. \u201cYou would think if you\u2019re in the\u00a0FBI or Department of\u00a0Justice, this is the biggest\u00a0thing you could be looking at,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0\u201cWhere are they?\u00a0I\u2019ve not seen anything.\u201d \u201cThey just keep moving\u00a0along and they go on to the next\u00a0president,\u201d he continued. TRUMP: DOJ 'MISSING IN ACTION' ON ALLEGED ELECTION FRAUD The Trump campaign has filed lawsuits in a number of key battleground states where President-elect Joe Biden led by a razor-thin margin. The Trump campaign has been alleging a widespread conspiracy to dump millions of illegal votes into the system, but has not provided substantial evidence to support those claims. The campaign\u2019s legal effort, led by Rudy Giuliani, has, in large part, been focused on Republican poll watchers being blocked from viewing vote counting at polling sites in some locations. Those claims have been dismissed by even Republican-appointed judges, who have said the cases lack evidence. Election officials in many of those states, though, have certified Biden\u2019s victory. Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, who also is leading the campaign's legal effort,\u00a0on Tuesday, fired back at Barr.\u00a0 \u201cWith all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn\u2019t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation,\" Giuliani and Ellis\u00a0said in a statement. \"We have gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined. We have many witnesses swearing under oath they saw crimes being committed in connection with voter fraud.\" They\u00a0added: \"As far as we know, not a single one has been interviewed by the DOJ. The Justice Department also hasn\u2019t audited any voting machines or used their subpoena powers to determine the truth.\"\u00a0 They\u00a0said that the campaign will \"continue our pursuit of the truth through the judicial system and state legislatures, and continue toward the Constitution\u2019s mandate and ensuring that every legal vote is counted and every illegal vote is not.\" \"Again, with the greatest respect to the Attorney General, his opinion appears to be without any knowledge or investigation of the substantial irregularities and evidence of systemic fraud,\" they said.\u00a0 Trump\u00a0has not yet conceded to Biden, despite allowing the formal transition process to begin, and continues to blast election officials in multiple states, while also claiming the 2020 presidential election was rigged. The Trump administration has said, though, that the 2020 election was the most secure ever. ARIZONA, WISCONSIN CERTIFY BIDEN AS ELECTION WINNER \"There's been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results,\u201d Barr told the AP. \u201cAnd the DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven't seen anything to substantiate that.\u201d Barr added that people have been confusing the use of the federal criminal justice system with allegations that should be made in civil lawsuits, adding that such a remedy for those complaints would be a top-down audit conducted by state or local officials, not the U.S. Justice Department. \"There's a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fix-all, and people don't like something they want the Department of Justice to come in and 'investigate,\"' Barr said, adding that there must be a basis to believe there is a crime to investigate. \"Most claims of fraud are very particularized to a particular set of circumstances or actors or conduct. They are not systemic allegations and. And those have been run down; they are being run down,\" Barr said. \"Some have been broad and potentially cover a few thousand votes. They have been followed up on.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News' Talia Kaplan and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
