STATE DEPARTMENT RESTRICTS VISAS FOR CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS, PROMPTING RETALIATION The administration also announced Friday that it has restricted visas for Chinese officials\u00a0and their immediate family to protect the U.S. from the Chinese Communist Party's\u00a0\u201cmalign influence.\" The change reduces the maximum validity of the visas\u00a0from 10 years to one month, the State Department said.

    "article_text": "Trump urges Georgia to vote in Senate runoffs at rally, still hits 'rigged' election With the Republican majority on the line in Georgia's Senate runoffs, President Trump returned\u00a0to the campaign trail Saturday for the first time since last month\u2019s presidential election. Along with first lady Melania Trump, he gave a night rally in Valdosta, Ga., for Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Trump described to the crowd how he saw the stakes\u00a0in the twin Senate runoffs.\u00a0 \"Very simply, you will decide whether your children will grow up in a socialist country or free country. Socialism is just the beginning for these people. They want to\u00a0go into a communistic form of government,\" the president continued.\u00a0 Trump said that Perdue's opponent, Jon Ossoff, and Loeffler's opponent, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, are the \"two most extreme, far-left, liberal candidates in history.\"\u00a0 Trump implored Georgians to vote, while still sowing distrust in the state's handling of elections.\u00a0 \"You must go vote, vote early. They cheated, they rigged our presidential election, but we will still win it. They're going to try and rig this election too.\" Trump then hit the state's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. \"Your governor could stop it very easily, if he knew what the hell he was doing.\" He said that Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger were \"afraid of Stacey Abrams,\" the former Democratic gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist.\u00a0 \"If I lost, I'd be a very gracious loser. If I lost, I'd go to Florida...but you can't ever accept what they steal and rig and rob. You can't accept it,\" Trump continued.\u00a0 Of the 2024 presidential election, Trump said, \"Hopefully, I\u00a0won't have to be a candidate.\" Just after the rally, the president took to Twitter to urge Georgians to register to vote before Monday, Dec. 12, and to request an absentee ballot before 12/31.\u00a0 \"The answer to the Democrat voter fraud is not to stay at home - that\u2019s what Pelosi and Schumer want you to do. If you want revenge on the Democrats for their efforts to steal the Presidential election, where we are fighting hard, you have to show up and vote in RECORD numbers!\" he added.\u00a0 Crowds of supporters lined up for hours\u00a0to attend the rally. Some even camped overnight, despite temperatures dropping to the mid-30s. As the\u00a0mostly maskless supporters stood in line waiting for temperature checks, a chant broke out: \"Stop the steal.\"\u00a0 On the eve of Trump\u2019s trip, Vice President Mike Pence -- in the Peach State for the second time since the kickoff of the twin Senate showdowns -- emphasized: \u201cPresident Trump and I need David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler back in the Republican majority in the United States Senate.\u201d BIDEN, OBAMA, PENCE, AND TRUMP WEIGH IN ON GEORGIA RUNOFFS Loeffler and Perdue are the\u00a0GOP candidates in the Jan. 5 elections, which will determine if Republicans hold the chamber, or if\u00a0Democrats control both the House and Senate, as well as the White House. AD SPENDING IN GEORGIA'S TWIN RUNOFF ELECTIONS SKYROCKETS \u00a0 Republicans desperately need Trump supporters to return to the polls a month from now, despite unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud in the Nov. 3 election. The balance of power for the next Senate coming out of last month\u2019s elections is 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats. That\u00a0means\u00a0Democrats must win both of Georgia\u2019s runoffs to make it a 50-50 split Senate. If that occurs, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote, giving her party a\u00a0razor-thin majority in the chamber. GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS SPUR PROBE INTO THIRD-PARTY GROUPS TRYING TO REGISTER OUT-OF-STATE VOTERS In Georgia, where state law dictates a runoff if no candidate garners\u00a050% of the vote, Perdue narrowly missed\u00a0avoiding a runoff, winning 49.75% of the vote. Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff\u00a0trailed by roughly 87,000 votes. In the other race, Loeffler captured nearly 26% of the vote in a whopping 20-candidate special election to fill the final two years of the term of former GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson. Democratic candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock won nearly 33% of the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important that Republicans are united in this fight against Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff,\u201d said Jesse Hunt, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the re-election arm of the Senate GOP.\u00a0 \u201cIt may sound clich\u00e9, but with two very consequential runoffs, turnout is critical.\u201d Hunt told Fox News that \u201cthe president\u2019s visit is going to be an event that energizes and mobilizes our Republican voters.\u201d The visit comes on the eve of Sunday\u2019s debate between Loeffler and Warnock, which will be\u00a0carried live nationally on Fox News. Trump continues to fight the results of the presidential contest in Georgia, a once solidly red state that\u2019s turned into a crucial battleground in recent years. President-elect Joe Biden carried the state by roughly 12,000 votes in last month\u2019s election. The results were backed up by a manual recount mandated by state officials. A second recount requested by the president, completed Friday, didn\u2019t alter the final result \u2013 and the election results were cerrtified. But as Biden prepares to take office, Trump has continued his assault\u00a0on the election. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE GEORGIA RUNOFFS The president this week tweeted or retweeted baseless charges of voter fraud in Georgia, and he\u2019s repeatedly attacked\u00a0Kemp and\u00a0 Raffensperger, who are both Trump supporters, for their refusal to\u00a0reverse the election results.  Conspiratorial claims by pro-Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Lin Wood this week further\u00a0roiled the waters. They filed lawsuits seeking to overturn Georgia\u2019s results. At a rally Wednesday, they went further, urging\u00a0GOP voters to not support Perdue and Loeffler, charging that the senators have not been supportive enough of Trump's\u00a0efforts to overturn the election. \u201cThey have not earned your vote. Don\u2019t you give it to them,\u201d Wood said. \u201cWhy would you go back and vote in another rigged election, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d That\u2019s got plenty of Republicans in Georgia pushing back. Former House Speaker and 2012 presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, who represented Georgia in Congress for decades, tweeted this week:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLin Wood and Sidney Powell are totally destructive. Every Georgia conservative who cares about America MUST vote in the runoff.\u201d Gabriel Sterling, a top Georgia election official and a Republican, predicted that voter fraud allegations\u00a0by Trump and his allies will\u00a0drive down GOP turnout in the Senate runoffs. \u201cAt this point, there\u2019s no way that it can\u2019t,\u201d he told CNN in an interview this week. On Friday, as his legal team filed a new lawsuit in Georgia, Trump tied the runoffs to his push to reverse the state\u2019s presidential election results as he once again demanded a signature audit of ballots. \u201cThe best way to insure a @KLoeffler and @sendavidperdue VICTORY is to allow signature checks in the Presidential race, which will insure a Georgia Presidential win,\u201d the president claimed. And he argued that \u201cSpirits will soar and everyone will rush out and VOTE!\u201d But ahead of the president\u2019s trip, a dozen and a half leading Georgia Republicans issued a statement urging that the focus turn from attacks over the Nov. 3 results to the Senate runoffs. \u201cWe have watched with increasing concern as the debate surrounding the state\u2019s electoral\u00a0system has made some within our Party consider whether voting in the coming run-off election\u00a0matters, \" the statement read.\u00a0\u00a0\"We say today, without equivocation, that without every vote cast for President Trump\u00a0and all our Republican candidates on November 3 also being cast in the U.S. Senate runoffs, the\u00a0trajectory of our State and Nation will be irreparably altered on January 5th.\u00a0Now is the time to unite our Party and win these U.S. Senate seats.\" Among those signing the statement were former Republican Sens.\u00a0Isakson, Saxby Chambliss and Mack Mattingly, and former GOP Gov. Nathan Deal.",

Steve Sisolak, essentially securing the state\u2019s six Electoral College votes for Biden. MIRANDA DEVINE CALLS NEVADA 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION REVIEW 'GOOD NEWS' Trump campaign attorney Jesse Binnall, told Judge James Russell that 1,506 votes received in the general election came from deceased voters, according to KLAS-TV of Las Vegas. Binnall also alleged that 42,284 voters\u00a0voted twice, roughly 20,000 voters were found to have voted without a Nevada mailing address and 2,468 voters had changed their address to another state. Trump\u2019s legal team said they focused on Nevada\u2019s election law that\u00a0allows mail-in ballots to be sent to every individual without the ballot having first been requested \u2013 a practice\u00a0that several states carried out\u00a0amid the coronavirus pandemic. Just prior to the Thursday hearing, the Nevada GOP posted a video on Twitter of 20 binders they said contained evidence supporting their claims. \"We have testimony from multiple witnesses reporting that the usb drives used in the election would show that vote tallies changed overnight,\u201d the group said on Twitter. \u00a0\u201cThat means in the dead of night, votes would appear or disappear on these voting machines during early voting and Election Day.\" Binnall alleged that Clark County\u00a0lacked proper security and scrutiny over their voting machines. \u201cIn the dead of night, votes appeared and votes reappeared without explanation, and there is no good explanation,\u201d Binnall said according to the local news outlet. But Russell pushed back on this point, noting that there is no way to tell who voted for whom, and asked\u00a0how this information changes the outcome of the election. \u201cIn a court of law it\u2019s evidence that counts, not tweets or social media bluster, not hearsay or speculation, it\u2019s evidence and that\u2019s what\u2019s missing in the record before the court,\u201d attorney Kevin Hamilton, representing the Democrats, said.

    "article_text": "Trump campaign, RNC raise $207.5 million since Election Day EXCLUSIVE: The Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee, their joint-fundraising committees and President Trump\u2019s new PAC Save America have raised $207.5 million since Election Day, Fox News has learned. Fox News has also learned that the entities, which include the campaign, the RNC, Trump Victory, and Trump Make America Great Again Committee, will file with the Federal Election Commission Thursday for the reporting period of Oct. 15 to Nov. 23, when they raised a total of $495\u00a0million. RNC VOWS TO SPEND AT LEAST $20 MILLION IN GEORGIA AHEAD OF JAN. 5 SENATE RUNOFFS The Save America PAC was formed just after Election Day, and its fundraising is\u00a0not included in that total of $495\u00a0million. A source close to the president told Fox News that the massive $207.5 million raised since Election Day \"reaffirms that POTUS is the big dog in the Republican Party.\"\u00a0 The source added that the numbers are still being done jointly with the RNC, showing that \"joint partnership remains strong.\"\u00a0 \u201cThese tremendous fundraising numbers show President Trump remains the leader and source of energy for the Republican Party, and that his supporters are dedicated to fighting for the rightful, legal outcome of the 2020 general election,\u201d Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien told Fox News. \u201cIt also positions President Trump to continue leading the fight to clean up our corrupt elections process in so many areas around the country, and to build on gains from the 2020 elections so we can take back the House and build on our Senate majority in 2022,\u201d Stepien added. The massive post-Election Day fundraising came amid legal challenges mounted by the Trump campaign in key battleground states across the nation, where President-elect Joe Biden led by a razor-thin margin. The Trump campaign has been alleging a widespread conspiracy to dump millions of illegal votes into the system, but has not provided substantial evidence to support those claims. The campaign\u2019s legal effort, led by Rudy Giuliani, has, in large part, been focused on Republican poll watchers being blocked from viewing vote counting at polling sites in some locations. Those claims have been dismissed\u00a0even by Republican-appointed judges, who have said the cases lack evidence. Election officials in many of those states have certified Biden\u2019s victory. The president, this week, despite refusing to concede to Biden, hinted that he may launch a 2024 campaign to return to the White House. \"It's been an amazing four years. We are trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I'll see you in four years,\"\u00a0the president told supporters on Tuesday night at a White House holiday party for members of the Republican National Committee. Two GOP sources who attended the function confirmed the president's comments to Fox News. Until now, Trump has remained quiet about the possibility of running to reclaim the White House in 2024. \"I don't want to talk to 2024 yet,\"\u00a0the president told reporters on Thanksgiving. But behind closed doors, Trump has told advisers that he wants to run again in four years\u00a0and\u00a0could potentially announce his bid before or even during Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, sources told Fox News. The Save America PAC allows Trump to continue to fundraise and maintain his hold on\u00a0the Republican Party even after he departs the White House. Trump campaign\u00a0communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News last month\u00a0that \u201cthe president always planned to do this, win or lose, so he can support candidates and issues he cares about, such as combating voter fraud.\u201d TRUMP HINTS AT 2024 PRESIDENTIAL BID Meanwhile, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News that \u201cthe American people know what\u2019s at stake.\u201d \u201cThanks to our incredible supporters, we\u2019ve been fighting tooth and nail to uphold election integrity across the country and defend our Senate Republicans in Georgia,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cWe are investing millions to push back against the Democrats\u2019 unprecedented power grab and drive a massive Get Out The Vote operation in the Peach State.\u201d She added: \u201cThe work we are doing today is critical to ensuring a better tomorrow for all Americans.\u201d McDaniel and Trump are slated to campaign in Georgia on Saturday for GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler ahead of the Jan. 5 runoffs.\u00a0 Fox News reported earlier this week that the RNC had committed to spending at least $20 million in Georgia in support of Perdue and Loeffler.\u00a0 The current balance of power for the next Senate coming out of this month\u2019s elections is 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats. That means Democrats must win both of Georgia\u2019s runoff elections to make it a 50-50 Senate. If that occurs, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote, giving her party a razor-thin majority in the upper chamber. In Georgia, state law dictates a runoff if no candidate reaches 50% of the vote. Last month, GOP\u00a0Sen.\u00a0David Perdue narrowly missed\u00a0avoiding a runoff, winning 49.75% of the vote.

Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr said this week that the Justice Department has not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. \u201cTo date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,\" Barr told The Associated Press.

Since then, speculation has flown on whether Trump will fire Barr in the coming weeks.\u00a0 Even prior to the election, Trump was banking on Barr's department\u00a0to deliver the results of an investigation into whether\u00a0former President Barack Obama conspired with senior FBI and other Justice Department officials to launch the Russia investigation in an attempt to derail Trump's administration.

    "article_text": "Trump's legacy on courts still building in waning days of presidency The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote next week on the nominee to fill the appeals court seat vacated by new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u00a0as well as voting on whether to send three other lower trial court nominees to the Senate floor \u2014 which could further cement President Trump\u2019s reshaping of the federal judiciary before he leaves office. This comes to the chagrin of Democrats who insist Republicans are violating tradition by continuing to confirm judges despite a Joe Biden victory in the presidential race. After hearings on nominees before the Thanksgiving recess, the committee is scheduled to\u00a0vote Dec. 10 on the nomination of Thomas L. Kirsch II to serve on the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, replacing Barrett. Kirsch is currently the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Indiana. The committee had been expected to vote Thursday, but ultimately held over the nominations to next week. There are only three current and known future vacancies on appeals courts, according to the Judicial Crisis Network, which monitors judicial nominations. Meanwhile, there are 59 current or known future vacancies on district and specialty courts, with 35 pending nominations. \u201cPeople focus less on district courts because they decide cases rather than make legal precedent,\u201d Curt Levey, president of the Committee for Justice, told Fox News. \u201cBut we have seen rogue district judges impose national injunctions during the Trump administration. They can make it difficult for a president and slow the administration of justice. What district courts do matter. A Trump-appointed district judge will be very different from a Biden-appointed district judge.\u201d JONATHAN TURLEY: GUN RIGHTS CASE TAILOR-MADE FOR JUSTICE BARRETT, SUPREME COURT. HERE'S WHY The Judiciary Committee will also vote Thursday on the nominations of Charles Edward Atchley Jr. and Katherine A. Crytzer, both to be judges for the Eastern District of Tennessee; on the nomination of Joseph Dawson III to be a judge for the District of South Carolina and for Zachary N. Somers to be a judge for the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. On Nov. 13, Trump announced his intent to nominate Ra\u00fal M. Arias-Marxuach to be a judge on the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. Arias-Marxuach is currently a district judge for the U.S. District Court of Puerto Rico. He is still awaiting a hearing. Trump\u2019s term expires on Jan. 20, 2021, but he is contesting the outcome of the Nov. 3 election in several states, even as Biden has been certified the winner in key battleground states. Still, with one term in office, Trump has already appointed more judges than his immediate predecessors who served two terms. On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Taylor B. McNeel to be a judge for the Southern District of Mississippi and\u00a0J. Philip\u00a0Calabrese to be a judge for the Northern District of Ohio\u00a0while four other lower court nominees are pending a Senate floor vote. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR PASSES ON BIDEN CABINET OFFER, SOURCES TELL FOX NEWS These recent confirmations mean a total of 229 Trump-appointed judges in just one term \u2014 so far, according to Courthouse News Service. Three of those appointments \u2014 Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 were to the U.S. Supreme Court. That\u2019s compared to Presidents Barack Obama, who managed to get a total of 160 judicial nominees over two terms, George W. Bush, who got a total of 204 nominees confirmed in eight years, and Bill Clinton, who scored 203 judicial appointments over two terms. Also falling short of Trump\u2019s single term \u2014 Obama, Clinton and Bush each appointed two Supreme Court justices. \u201cThe most important thing Trump did in judicial nominations is break free from the traditional Republican method of picking jurists,\u201d J. Christian Adams, a former Justice Department lawyer, now president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, told Fox News. \u201cTrump picked conservatives who have battle scars and who have fought the fight. That\u2019s what prevents us from getting another David Souter on the Supreme Court.\u201d Shortly after the election, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters: \u201cI think we got some district court judges that were Republican and Democrat. But, yeah, the committee will keep operating.\u201d Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told radio host Hugh Hewitt before the election, \u201cWe go through the end of the year, and so does the president.\u201d KENTUCKY AG TAKES STATE'S CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS TO SUPREME COURT IN BID TO OPEN RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS However, outgoing ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said in a Nov. 12 letter to Graham \u201cit is imperative\u201d the committee cease processing nominations to allow Biden to make nominations for remaining vacancies\u00a0in keeping with a \u201clong and established tradition in presidential election years\u201d after the party in power has lost. \u201cGoing back to 1984, the Committee has only twice held a nomination hearing in the lame duck period of a presidential election year \u2014 once in 2004, following President George W. Bush\u2019s reelection, and once in 2012, following the reelection of President Obama,\u201d Feinstein said in the letter to Graham. \u201cUnlike President Bush and Obama, President Trump has lost his reelection bid.\u201d Critics of Senate Republicans have noted the \u201cThurmond rule\u201d named for the late South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond that calls for the Senate not to approve circuit court nominees in the months leading to Election Day, while others contend that not since Republican William McKinley\u2019s election in 1896, when a Democratic Senate approved several of President Grover Cleveland\u2019s judges, has a party that lost the race for the White House continued confirming judicial nominees. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But the Senate confirmed future Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer to a seat on the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in late 1980 after the man who nominated Breyer \u2014 Democratic President Jimmy Carter \u2014 lost in a landslide to Republican Ronald Reagan, noted Levey of the Committee for Justice.",

    "article_text": "Trump says if he's right about election fraud, 'Biden can't be president' President Trump is once again charging that last month\u2019s presidential election was rigged and rampant with fraud. In an address posted on his Twitter and Facebook pages that the president described as possibly \u201cthe most important speech, I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d Trump charged that \u201clots of bad things happened\u201d during the election. WHISTLEBLOWERS SHARE FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS OF ALLEGED ELECTION IRREGULARITIES And he argued that\u00a0\"if we are right about the fraud, Joe Biden can't be president. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of votes. We're talking about numbers like nobody has ever seen before.\" Taking aim again at the surge in absentee balloting and early voting due to health concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic, the president emphasized that \u201cwe used to have what was called Election Day. Now we have election days, weeks and months, and lots of bad things happened during this ridiculous period of time.\u201d \"The mail and voting scam is the latest part of their four-year effort to overturn the results of the 2016 election. And it's been like living in hell,\" Trump argued. TRUMP HINTS AT 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN WHITE HOUSE COMMENTS And the president vowed that he\u2019s \u201cdetermined to protect our election system,\u201d which he claimed, \u201cis now under coordinated assault and siege.\u201d Twitter, as it has for numerous Trump tweets regarding charges of election fraud, added a disclaimer that said \u201cThis claim about election fraud is disputed.\u201d And Facebook noted that \u201cJoe Biden is the projected winner of the US Presidential election.\u201d Trump\u2019s speech, recorded in the Diplomatic Room of the White House, came one day after Attorney General William Barr said in an interview with the Associated Press that following inquiries by the Justice Department and the F.B.I., \u00a0\u201cto date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d And it comes as a growing number of members of his own party have broken with Trump over his claims of voter fraud. The president has refused to concede to Biden, more than three and a half weeks after Fox News, the Associated Press and other news organizations projected that the former vice president would win enough electoral votes to defeat Trump and become president-elect.  Trump's legal team filed a spate of lawsuits in many of the key battleground states, in hopes of delaying the certification of the election, but the tactics have been unsuccessful to date. And recounts requested by Trump in Georgia and Wisconsin, two of the six key battleground states that Biden narrowly edged Trump and which the president has contested, have to date failed to alter Biden's victories. On Sunday, in his first interview since the election, Trump once again claimed that the \"election was a fraud; it was a rigged election.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS FROM FOX NEWS \"We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account,\" the president charged without backing up his claim, in a conversation with FOX\u00a0Business' Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that his legal bid to overturn the election results \"probably\" wouldn't reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has been the goal of his legal team. In his speech on Wednesday, the president said that \u201cwe are going to defend the honesty of the vote by ensuring that every legal ballot is counted and that no illegal ballot is counted.\u201d And he emphasized that his efforts are \u201cabout ensuring that Americans can have faith in this election and in all future elections.\u201d",

McEnany quoted prominent Democrats such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and examples of liberals in power who disagreed with Trump on the issue. But, liberal journalists also have mocked Trump for wanting to keep schools open. FAUCI: 'CLOSE THE BARS, KEEP THE SCHOOLS OPEN' TO MITIGATE COMMUNITY SPREAD McEnany noted that Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin once declared that Trump wants to \u201ckill your kids\u201d by keeping them in school. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s responsible reporting,\u201d McEnany said. McEnany then turned her attention to Cooper, a\u00a0CNN anchor, who also condemned the idea of allowing children to learn inside an actual classroom. \u201cYou had Anderson Cooper saying that he actually doesn't care about kids at all, nor about the health of their teachers and parents,\u201d McEnany said. She then noted that Trump has \u201cfollowed the science\u201d all along when it came\u00a0to the polarizing topic. DE BLASIO TO REOPEN NYC SCHOOLS, SAYS HE HEARD PARENTS 'LOUD AND CLEAR' \u201cHe\u2019s also kept in mind, we have a Constitution, and he will be unashamed and always advocating for the science and the best interest of the children of this country,\u201d McEnany said before walking away from the podium and ending the briefing.

They simply followed longstanding guidance from elections officials issued under the law,\" a statement said. \"These arguments to disenfranchise large groups of Wisconsin voters were resoundingly rejected by the Dane and Milwaukee County Boards of Canvassers during the recount process, frequently on a bipartisan basis.\" The Trump campaign claims\u00a0officials on the Wisconsin Election Commission and the City Clerks of Milwaukee and Madison \u201cwillfully disregarded the current statute and made conscious efforts to circumvent Wisconsin election law,\u201d resulting in tens of thousands of votes cast \u201cwell outside of the bounds of Wisconsin law.\u201d It also asserts\u00a0the law was violated \u201con several occasions\u201d through what it\u00a0described as altered-certification absentee ballot envelopes, a lack of required absentee ballot applications, unlawful claims of indefinite confinement\u00a0and voting events called \u201cDemocracy in the Park.\u201d Wisconsin law requires that written absentee ballot request forms must be submitted ahead of the voter casting their absentee ballot, but the Trump campaign claimed that election officials, instead, \u201caccepted ballots without the required absentee applications on file.\u201d TRUMP HASN'T CONCEDED, BUT HE'S BEEN SECRETLY CONSIDERING 2024 \u201cThe Wisconsin State Legislature has explicitly required an application,\u201d a Trump campaign official told Fox News, saying it is \u201cmandatory and any ballots without an application or with an incomplete application are not to be counted.\u201d The campaign said ballots cast without the initial absentee ballot applications on file \u201cmust be called into question.\u201d Next, the campaign pointed to Wisconsin law, which requires any ballots that are incorrectly filled out, missing information\u00a0or damaged to\u00a0be returned to the voter to correct and resubmit. But the lawsuit alleges municipal clerks were \u201cillegally altering ballot envelopes themselves.\u201d \u201cIn many instances, witness addresses were left off of the envelopes and clerks, using their own knowledge or searching in unknown databases, filled in the information themselves,\u201d a campaign official told Fox News. \u201cAccording to the statute, this is illegal.\u201d DISTRICT JUDGE HALTS 3 GEORGIA COUNTIES FROM ERASING DOMINION VOTING MACHINE DATA \u201cIf the certificate or envelope is missing a witness address, the ballot cannot be counted until the voter corrects the error \u2014 plain and simple,\u201d the official added. \u201cInstead, election officials decided to take the law into their own hands.\u201d The official added: \u201cThese ballots were fraudulently completed and counted, and the illegal ballots should not count toward the certified vote totals.\u201d The lawsuit also alleges voters were \u201cfraudulently allowed by election officials\u201d to circumvent voter ID laws by claiming absentee voting status that, under state law, was only to be used for voters who are \u201cindefinitely confined.\u201d The status of \u201cindefinite confinement\u201d in Wisconsin is intended for voters who are \u201cphysically ill, infirm, elderly or disabled\u201d and for those who are \u201cunable to vote in person under those terms.\u201d The campaign claimed that due to the \u201cconfusion and misinformation from Democratic election officials\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic, many voters requested that status \u201ceven though they definitely were not confined.\u201d \u201cThis allowed voters abusing the status to vote without providing identification, as required by law,\u201d the official explained. HOWARD KURTZ: DEMOCRATS HAVE A RURAL AMERICA PROBLEM THAT'S HURTING THEM ON THE HILL The campaign said that in March, Democrat election officials \u201cfalsely told voters they could claim this status because of the pandemic\u201d but said that was \u201clater struck down by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\u201d The Trump campaign said that from 2016 to 2020, the number of indefinitely confined voters increased \u201cdramatically\u201d \u2014 nearly 600% in Dane County and about 500% in Milwaukee County. The lawsuit also will claim that clerks \u201cdid not do their due diligence to remove voters fraudulently claiming\u201d that status and \u201cmade no good faith effort to check publicly available information and remove indefinite confinement permissions from illegitimate voters.\u201d The lawsuit alleges that anyone who cast a ballot under the terms of indefinite confinement without meeting that criteria \u201cdid so fraudulently,\u201d and therefore, their \u201cillegal ballots must not be counted.\u201d Meanwhile, the campaign also alleged that the city of Madison created \u201cunlawful polling locations at over 200 locations throughout the city\u2019s Democracy in the Park voting events\u201d and said the ballots accepted at the events \u201cwere illegally cast.\u201d The campaign claimed\u00a0the polling locations were held outside of the county\u2019s \u201capproved polling locations and did not follow the state\u2019s strict absentee voting requirements.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s truly alarming about these events is that not only did they not follow the law, but Joe Biden\u2019s campaign encouraged this unlawful voting,\u201d a campaign official told Fox News, claiming the Biden campaign \u201cadvertised these events as opportunities to vote, telling voters to bring their completed ballot to turn in or their incomplete ballot to have a so-called \u2018poll worker\u2019 serve as a witness before you fill it out and turn it in.\u201d \u201cThis highlights inappropriate coordination between the Biden campaign and the city\u2019s election officials,\u201d the official said, noting that voters \u201care not allowed to turn in their absentee ballots anywhere other than designated polling locations.\u201d A Trump campaign official told Fox News its\u00a0lawsuit is to ensure that \u201clegal voters are not being disenfranchised by ensuring only legal votes are counted,\u201d adding that Democrat election officials' \u201cmotive is clear.\u201d \u201cThey want Joe Biden to win at all costs, regardless of whether the votes for him are legal or illegal,\u201d the official said, adding that the \u201ccourt must do the right thing and remove the illegal ballots from the certified vote total.\u201d The Wisconsin Election Commission told Fox News that they do not comment on lawsuits.\u00a0Neither Evers\u00a0nor the Biden campaign immediately responded to Fox News' request for comment.\u00a0 The Trump campaign\u2019s Wisconsin legal team told Fox News it had more than 4,000 volunteers working throughout the recount in the state. The lawsuit comes after Evers certified Wisconsin\u2019s results for Biden. \u201cWith Governor Evers\u2019 premature certification, he is saying the President of the United States has no right to go to court in order to have illegal ballots examined,\u201d Troupis told Fox News. \u201cHe\u2019s not saying we have a frivolous lawsuit \u2014 he is saying we have no right to judicial review \u2014 that\u2019s another level of bad.\u201d Troupis added: \u201cThe idea that great law firms and great lawyers would not get involved in cases like this because they\u2019re afraid is the reason I took this case in the first instance.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 40 years, representing plenty of Democrats and Republicans, and I will not back down when it comes to upholding the law or protecting the integrity of our elections,\u201d Troupis told Fox News. \u201cWe, as good lawyers, don\u2019t back down, and if we do, our republic is done.\u201d Trump has refused to concede to Biden, now\u00a0more than three weeks after Fox News, the Associated Press and other news networks projected that Biden would win enough electoral votes to defeat him and become president-elect. The president\u2019s legal team, in other areas across the nation, filed a spate of lawsuits in many key battlegrounds\u00a0in hopes of delaying the certification of the election, but the tactics have been unsuccessful to date. The recount in Wisconsin, as well as the one requested by Trump in Georgia, also failed so far to alter Biden\u2019s victories. In his first interview since this month's election, Trump once again claimed\u00a0the \"election was a fraud; it was a rigged election.\u201d \"We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account,\" the president charged without backing up his claim\u00a0in a conversation with FOX\u00a0Business' Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that his legal bid to overturn the election results \"probably\" wouldn't reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has been the goal of his legal team.",

    "article_text": "Georgia Rep.-elect Carolyn Bourdeaux, only Democrat to flip seat, says party should talk to Trump supporters Georgia Rep.-elect Carolyn\u00a0Bourdeaux fell just 433 votes shy of becoming a congresswoman in 2018 in the tightest House\u00a0race in the country. But two years later, the college professor and public policy expert mounted a comeback by beating GOP emergency room physician\u00a0Rich McCormick by more than 10,000 votes and becoming the first woman to represent Georgia's 7th Congressional District. Her win in\u00a0November in\u00a0suburban Atlanta was a\u00a0major bright spot for House Democrats who otherwise had a tough 2020 election by losing unexpected seats and shrinking their majority. Bourdeaux arrived in Washington, D.C., recently for congressional orientation as the only Democrat to flip a red seat in earnest. Bourdeaux said the key for Democrats having future success will be to\u00a0listen to non-Democrats\u00a0as well. \"We need to pay a lot of attention to the\u00a0diverse communities of this country,\" Bourdeaux\u00a0told Fox News in an interview in\u00a0Washington, \"and that diversity includes people who supported Trump and people who are\u00a0not in our camp. One of the things I did over and over was just sit and listen to people.\" REP.-ELECT CARLOS GIMENEZ, FORMER MIAMI-DADE MAYOR, CONDEMNS OTHER MAYORS THAT 'ALLOWED MOB RULE' Democrats picked up two more open\u00a0House seats in North Carolina because of new congressional district maps. But\u00a0Bourdeaux remains the only Democrat to flip an existing red district blue. Meanwhile, Republicans flipped a dozen seats from blue to red and weakened the Democrats' majority. Bourdeaux credits her\u00a0win to putting in the work of building the Democratic Party infrastructure of registering voters, especially in the Asian American community, to the mobilizing efforts of\u00a0young organizers and meeting with people of all backgrounds. She said she visited mosques, synagogues and churches,\u00a0talked to the local Rotary Club, Chamber of Commerce\u00a0and Black fraternities and sororities to brainstorm solutions on issues important to them. She focused her campaign on universal messages of improving health care, fighting the coronavirus\u00a0and getting people back to work and school. \"It's a combination of message and then work,\" Bourdeaux said of her success in a traditionally Republican area of Georgia.\u00a0 The 2020 election delivered mixed results, with Joe Biden winning the White House and Georgia -- the first time a Democrat carried the Peach State since Bill Clinton in 1992. But Democrats lost seats in the House, and Biden's only hope of having Democrats control the Senate is by winning twin runoff elections on Jan. 5 in Georgia.\u00a0 REP.-ELECT LAUREN BOEBERT PLANS THANKSGIVING 'FUNERAL' FOR DEAD TURKEY IN DEFIANCE OF COLORADO GUIDELINES \"It was a double wave election where both sides really turned out in huge numbers,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said. \"I don't know if there's anything clear except that we are a purple nation.\u00a0... We're just going to have to find a way to focus on the problem and then work together to find a solution.\u201d Top of her list is\u00a0solving the coronavirus crisis and\u00a0improving health care.\u00a0It's\u00a0unacceptable that so many middle-class families are priced out of buying health care and those with insurance still can't afford to pay for prescription drugs or cover\u00a0their medical bills, she said. Health care problems hit close to home. Her\u00a0parents' health care costs become so expensive, they drained their bank accounts and couldn't afford to\u00a0pay for their medications. Bourdeaux's mother cared for her sick father for 10 years\u00a0until both her parents passed away in 2017, she said. \"I have my own personal story. My\u00a0father was sick for a decade. My mother took care of him and all of their discretionary income was eaten up paying for his prescription medications,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said. REP.-ELECT TONY GONZALES HELPS GOP HOLD TEXAS BORDER DISTRICT: 'MY STORY IS THE AMERICAN DREAM' In talking to a range of voters over the years, she saw that health care struggles are too common. \"I think everybody had a health care horror story,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said, relaying stories of maternity care and unexpected billing.\u00a0 \"I cannot believe we allow this to happen to us. And so those are the kind of things that we need to fix and ... I'm already talking to people about working in a bipartisan fashion.\" Growing up in Roanoke, Va., as the daughter of educators,\u00a0Bourdeaux earned admission to\u00a0Yale University where she got her\u00a0bachelor's degree\u00a0with the help of\u00a0grants and federal loans. She went on to receive a master's in public administration from the University of Southern California and a Ph.D. in public administration from Syracuse University. Bourdeaux, 50, is an associate professor at Georgia State University teaching classes centered on\u00a0public service, policy\u00a0and budgeting. She's a wife and mother to an 8-year-old son. ASHLEY HINSON, FORMER TV NEWS ANCHOR, IS LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS \u2014 NOT TO 'LAUNCH FIREBOMBS' IN CONGRESS She brings to Washington a deep policy expertise\u00a0that she wants to put to use to find bipartisan solutions, especially on health care. She previously\u00a0tackled legislative issues in Washington, D.C., as an aide to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and was the\u00a0former director of the nonpartisan Georgia Senate Budget Office where she worked with both parties to balance the budget during the Great Recession.\u00a0 \"I had solved problems during the last\u00a0worst crisis this country had faced and I had done it\u00a0in\u00a0a bipartisan basis. I got the job done for people,\"\u00a0Bourdeaux said.\u00a0 In contrast to the Democratic socialist wing of the party, Bourdeaux takes a more measured approach to health care, policing, free college tuition and more. She wants to improve the Affordable Care Act and add\u00a0a public option but doesn't back \"Medicare for all.\" She didn't run on the Green New Deal; instead, she talks of having a Marshall Plan level of investment in clean-energy jobs and building up a green transit system. \"I'm very interested in ... having a big infrastructure investment,\" Bourdeaux said. \"We need it anyway. If\u00a0you've driven through Atlanta, we have soul-sucking commutes and horrific traffic.\" Bourdeaux thinks police departments may actually need more funding, not less, to support better\u00a0training and community policing programs.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I have never said defund the police,\" she said. \"That's just a made-up argument and it takes away from a very important conversation we need to be having about race.\" REP.-ELECT DIANA HARSHBARGER SAYS CONGRESS IS NO MATCH 'FOR A WOMAN WHO CAN MULTITASK' As a college professor, Bourdeaux understands firsthand the struggles students face trying to pay\u00a0for school but says families\u00a0need to have some skin in the game.\u00a0\"I believe in affordable. I don't know that I can get you to free.\" When she recently arrived in Washington, D.C., Bourdeaux\u00a0took stock of her\u00a0historic victory. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It's\u00a0an extraordinary honor to be here and to go step on the House floor where so many historic debates have taken place,\" Bourdeaux said.\u00a0\"I don't think you run for an office like that unless you really deeply believe in the country. You see the Capitol building and you're like: 'I\u00a0can't believe\u00a0I'm going to have the privilege of working there.' It truly is very, very moving.\"",

    "article_text": "Would a Trump 2024 announcement freeze out GOP rivals? As he keeps fighting the 2020 election results and refuses to concede to President-elect Joe Biden, President Trump remains quiet about the possibility of running to reclaim the White House in 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to 2024 yet,\u201d the president told reporters on Thanksgiving. ARIZONA, WISCONSIN,\u00a0 FINALIZE BIDEN ELECTION VICTORIES IN THE TWO KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES But behind closed doors, Trump has told advisors that he wants to run again in four years, and\u00a0could potentially announce his bid before or even during Biden's Inauguration on Jan. 20, according to Fox News\u2019 chief White House correspondent John Roberts, who confirmed a report from The Daily Beast. Such an announcement, or even Trump\u2019s flirtation with a third White House run, would definitely put a damper on what was thought to be a wide open battle for the GOP 2024 presidential nomination. And it could potentially freeze out early moves by other Republicans with national aspirations. Republican strategist and GOP presidential campaign veteran Alex Conant says a Trump 2024 announcement would \u201cabsolutely\u201d change the dynamic of the next White House race, \u201cat least at the outset.\u201d \u201cNobody wants to be the first candidate to challenge Trump in 2024. If it were truly an open race, you\u2019d see a lot of potential candidates making some aggressive early moves, going to Iowa, New Hampshire,\u201d noted Conant, a founding partner of consulting firm Firehouse Strategies. \u201cYou would normally see candidates going through the early states before the end of this year.\u201d AN EARLY LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL 2024 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL FIEELD While some potential 2024 GOP White House hopefuls \u2013 such as Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, former ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem - campaigned in Iowa and New Hampshire this autumn on behalf of the president and down ballot Republicans, nothing\u2019s on the schedule so far for the rest of this year. \u201c2024 candidates don\u2019t want to talk about Donald Trump. They want to talk about themselves. But so long as he is making noises about running again, the race will be all about him. And these candidates will be less inclined to do the early state travel because it will all be in the shadow of whether or not Trump runs again,\u201d Conant highlighted. Longtime GOP consultant David Carney agrees that with the president mulling a bid to return to the White House, it\u2019s a far different scenario than the wide open fields for the GOP presidential nominations in 2008, 2012, and 2016. But Carney, a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns for three decades, emphasized \u201cI don\u2019t think any serious candidate would be scared off because it\u2019s four years. No one knows what\u2019s really going to happen with the president. I don\u2019t see it having much affect right now.\u201d Carney, the founder of the Norway Hill Associates communications and public relations firm, suggested that \u201cmaybe two dozen people are thinking of dipping their toes into the waters and see what happens.\u201d CONSERVATIVE NATIONAL REVIEW RIPS TRUMP'S POST-ELECTION MOVES Dan Eberhart, a prominent donor and bundler for the president and other Republicans, pointed to a waning in the president\u2019s clout. \u201cWhether he likes it or not, the Trump ice cube is melting. He can announce a 2024 bid but the enthusiasm with donors is likely to fund the coffers of people like Cotton, Haley, (Sen. Josh) Hawley (of Missouri), or (Florida Gov. Ron) DeSantis to do battle with Trump,\u201d Eberhart, the CEO of the oil drilling company Canary LLC, told Fox News. Trump has made it clear that he intends to stay very involved in Republican Party politics after he leaves the White House in late January. He set up a leadership PAC immediately after this month\u2019s election, and much of the fundraising the past few weeks for his legal moves to contest the election results are being steered to the new organization. Trump also endorsed Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel \u2013 a major ally \u2013 for another term steering the national party committee.  The president is also heading to Georgia on Saturday, to campaign on behalf of the two Republican incumbents in the state's twin Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections, where the GOP's majority in the chamber is at stake. TRUMP SWIPES AT DEWINE AFTER OHIO GOVERNOR RECOGNIZES BIDEN ELECTION VICTORY Trump took aim earlier this month at Gov. Mike DeWine, a day after the Ohio Republican called Biden the president-elect and said that \u201cwe need to begin\u201d the transition between the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration. And on Monday he slammed GOP Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia as \u201chapless\u201d for allowing a \u201csham\u201d recount in the state\u2019s presidential results, which upheld Biden\u2019s narrow victory over Trump.  Both governors are up for re-election in 2022 and could be targeted by Trump. Many Republican member of Congress have yet to urge the president to concede to Biden and have refused to recognize Biden as the election winner, out of apparent fear of the president\u2019s strong backing from Republican voters. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans in New Hampshire, the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House, say they would like to see Trump make a 2024 bid to return to the White House. That\u2019s according to a survey from the University of New Hampshire (UNH) conducted Nov. 19-23. \u201cUntil Republicans come up with an obvious person to replace Trump, he\u2019s going to be seen as the front-runner going into 2024,\u201d noted UNH Survey Center director Andrew Smith. And that\u2019s a problem for other potential GOP presidential contenders. \u201cThe last thing they want to do is have a big press conference in New Hampshire where they leave the impression that they\u2019re going to challenge Donald Trump. Because what\u2019s he going to do \u2013 he\u2019ll start tweeting at them. It\u2019s such a distraction for what they would normally be trying to do right now,\u201d Conant noted. In the absence of very public early state visits, Conant says White House hopefuls \u201cwill continue to do all the behind the scenes work \u2013 talking to donors, calling activists, they\u2019ll do media, they\u2019ll start to build out a team, but just have to be more deferential about it now.\u201d Fox News' chief White House correspondent John Roberts contributed to this report",

    "article_text": "Dr. Scott Atlas resigns as special adviser to Trump on coronavirus EXCLUSIVE: Dr. Scott Atlas, President Trump\u2019s special adviser on the coronavirus pandemic, formally resigned from his post on Monday, Fox News has learned. Atlas, who spoke with the president on Monday, joined the administration in August, and was considered a Special Government Employee (SGE), serving a 130-day detail. Atlas\u2019 role is set to expire this week. COVID-19 VACCINES WILL BE READY WITHIN 24 HOURS OF FDA APPROVAL, AZAR SAYS Fox News exclusively obtained Atlas\u2019s resignation letter Monday, which was dated Dec. 1. In it,\u00a0Atlas touted the Trump administration's work on the coronavirus pandemic, while wishing \"all the\u00a0best\" to the incoming Biden administration. \u201cI am writing to resign from my position as Special Advisor to the President of the United States,\u201d Atlas said, thanking him for \u201cthe honor and privilege to serve on behalf of the American people.\u201d \u201cI worked hard with a singular focus\u2014to save lives and help Americans through this pandemic,\u201d Atlas wrote, adding that he \u201calways relied on the latest science and evidence, without any political consideration or influence.\u201d \u201cAs time went on, like all scientists and health policy scholars, I learned new information and synthesized the latest data from around the world, all in an effort to provide you with the best information to serve the greater public good,\u201d Atlas wrote. \u201cBut, perhaps more than anything, my advice was always focused on minimizing all the harms from both the pandemic and the structural policies themselves, especially to the working class and the poor.\u201d Atlas, who had been criticized throughout his tenure for calling for a reopening, and saying that lockdowns are \u201cextremely harmful\u201d to Americans, said that \u201calthough some may disagree with those recommendations, it is the free exchange of ideas that lead to scientific truths, which are the very foundation of a civilized society.\u201d \u201cIndeed, I cannot think of a time where safeguarding science and the scientific debate is more urgent,\u201d Atlas said. Atlas went on to tout his work at the White House, and his work with \u201cseveral selfless colleagues in designing specific policies to heighten protection of the vulnerable while safely reopening schools and society.\u201d Atlas pointed to their efforts in increasing and prioritizing \u201cextra personal protective equipment and tens of millions of extra tests to nursing and assisted living facilities,\u201d as well as implementing \u201cmore frequent monitoring updates using clinical guidelines to intensify testing,\u201d and instituting outreach to independent seniors in communities. \u201cWe also successfully designed rational guidelines for safely opening schools, a strategic use of the newly developed testing program, and a national stockpile of drugs for future crises,\u201d Atlas wrote. Shifting to lockdowns he has warned against throughout his tenure, Atlas said they \u201cidentified and illuminated early on the harms of prolonged lockdowns, including that they create massive physical health losses and psychological distress, destroy families and damage our children.\u201d \u201cAnd more and more, the relatively low risk to children of serious harms from the infection, the less frequent spread from children, the presence of immunologic protection beyond that shown by antibody testing, and the severe harms from closing schools and society are all being acknowledged,\u201d Atlas added. ATLAS FIRES BACK AGAINST CRITICISMS, SAYS ADVICE BASED ON 'CURRENT SCIENCE' Atlas also touted Operation Warp Speed, and the team that \u201cdelivered on our promised timelines for new drugs and vaccines.\u201d \u201cI congratulate you for your vision, and also congratulate the many who did the exemplory work\u2014we know who they are, even though their names are not those familiar to the public,\u201d Atlas wrote. Atlas went on to wish the best to the incoming Biden Administration. \u201cI sincerely wish the new team all the best as they guide the nation through these trying, polarized times,\u201d Atlas wrote. \u201cWith the emerging treatments and vaccines, I remain highly optimistic that America will thrive once again and overcome the adversity of the pandemic and all that it has entailed.\u201d Atlas, during his tenure, sparred with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Over the summer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield reportedly criticized Atlas, claiming that \u201ceverything he says is false.\u201d Atlas defended his record and his expertise, and maintained that all of his advice to the president was based on the \u201ccurrent science.\u201d \u201cI was asked to be an adviser on the coronavirus pandemic to the president of the United States and I was asked to do that because I have a 25-year career at top, elite medical centers, as a doctor and in patient care,\u201d Atlas told Fox News this summer. \u201cI also have a 15-year career in public policy, working on health care policy and integrating my medical knowledge in policy.\u201d Atlas added that before his arrival to the White House this summer, \u201cthat expertise had not been present.\u201d \u201cI am here because I understand how to translate complex medical science into plain English for the president of the United States and for everyone else in the White House, and derive\u00a0appropriate public policy from that information,\u201d Atlas said at the time, adding that there is a \u201cfalse belief\u201d that one \u201chas to be a public health official to understand the facts about the pandemic.\u201d \u201cThe way I advise the president is perfectly consistent with the most appropriate strategy for dealing with this pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cOne, target diligent protection of the high risk and vulnerable populations, and two, open up schools and society.\u201d Meanwhile, as for a coronavirus vaccine, the Trump administration said deliveries of the vaccine will begin as early as this week, and would be available first for front-line workers, medical personnel and senior citizens. The president, on Thanksgiving, argued that his opponent, President-elect Joe\u00a0Biden, should not be given credit for the vaccines, which he referred to as a \"medical miracle\"\u00a0before repeating claims of voting irregularities in the 2020 election. \"Joe Biden failed with the swine flu, H1N1, totally failed with the swine flu,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"Don't let him take credit for the vaccines because the vaccines were me and I pushed people harder than they've ever been pushed before and we got that approved and through and nobody's ever seen anything like it.\"\u00a0 Trump's comments came ahead of a\u00a0Dec. 10 meeting, where regulators at the Food and Drug Administration will review\u00a0Pfizer's request for an emergency use authorization for its vaccine developed with BioNTech.\u00a0 The latest trial data for Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine,\u00a0unveiled earlier this month, showed it was 90% effective. In addition, Moderna said its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19. AstraZeneca also reported preliminary results that showed its vaccine efficacy ranged from 62% to 90%, depending on the dosage amount given to participants. According to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, the vaccines will be \u201cshipped\u201d within 24 hours of FDA approval and then it would be up to \u201cnursing homes, hospitals, and pharmacies to get that dispensed.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt really could be within days of FDA approval we\u2019ll start seeing vaccines in people\u2019s arms which is frankly incredible,\u201d Azar said Monday. The United States has reported more than 13.5 million cases of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, and more than 267,000 deaths.",

    "article_text": "Trump lawyers allege Arizona election fraud conspiracy in GOP 'hearing' President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani urged Arizona state legislators to get to the bottom of an alleged voter fraud conspiracy\u00a0during a \"hearing\" Monday, the same day that the state certified\u00a0the election for\u00a0Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. \"You also had numerous situations of your workers, your citizens, observing the poll officials helping people vote to the point of telling them who to vote for,\" Giuliani said. \"Poll workers being observed changing votes, taking ambiguous votes and making sure they were cast for Biden.\" DISTRICT JUDGE HALTS 3 GEORGIA COUNTIES FROM ERASING DOMINION VOTING MACHINE DATA Giuliani questioned retired Army Col. Phil Waldron, presented as a cybersecurity expert\u00a0during the meeting, which was attended by Arizona state lawmakers and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. Waldron also spoke at Giuliani's meeting about election fraud concerns with Pennsylvania state lawmakers last week. Waldron warned of potential voter fraud in Arizona's Maricopa and Pima Counties, the state's two most populous counties,\u00a0and said that\u00a0Dominion's voting machines are vulnerable to hackers or on-site manipulation. Waldron claimed that a Maricopa County official said the county did not validate signatures on some ballots, creating a \"1.9 million vote fraud potential.\" That official has not produced an affidavit, he\u00a0said. Waldron also claimed that a witness from Pima County said votes were \"embedded\" in various precincts to achieve a Biden win. \"What I\u00a0take from your testimony, Colonel, is that 35,000 votes were embedded to each Democratic candidate in Pima County, the allegation by the gentleman who hasn't\u00a0given us an affidavit,\" Giuliani said. \"We don\u2019t know if the gentleman is telling the truth or not.\" TRUMP PRESSES GEORGIA\u00a0GOVERNOR TO OVERRULE SECRETARY OF STATE, SCRUTINIZE BALLOT SIGNATURES So far, courts and state and local election officials have not found evidence of widespread voter fraud, enough to overturn the results of the election.\u00a0Biden ended up carrying the state by just over 10,000 votes, or three-tenths of one percent of the vote. Eleven electoral votes were up for grabs in Arizona. Dominion, which is used by several\u00a0states, has pushed back against such claims. Michael Steel, a spokesman for Dominion, previously denied claims that votes cast through the company\u2019s systems were at risk of being altered. He said it is physically impossible to alter votes in the system. \"Look, when a voter votes on a Dominion machine, they fill out a ballot on a touch screen. They are given a printed copy which they then give to a local election official for safekeeping. If any electronic interference had taken place, the tally reported electronically would not match the printed ballots. and in every case where we've looked\u00a0at -- in Georgia, all across the country -- the printed ballot, the gold standard in election security, has matched the electronic tally,\"\u00a0he said. MCSALLY CONCEDES TO MARK KELLY IN ARIZONA SENATE RACE Trump's defeat in Arizona - since the margin was greater than a tenth of one percent - doesn't qualify for an automatic recount. While there's no provision in the state for a losing candidate to request a recount, Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward has indicated the state party will file a challenge to the results after they were certified. Amid the ongoing legal battle, the incoming Biden administration has\u00a0received ascertainment from the U.S. General Services Administration\u00a0as the apparent winner of the election, giving the green light to move\u00a0ahead with transition proceedings.

    "article_text": "Arizona certifies Biden as election winner, with Wisconsin following hours later President Trump suffered another setback in his push to overturn his defeat in the presidential election,\u00a0as Arizona\u00a0on Monday certified President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the state. The results of the election were certified by Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who's a Democrat, with GOP Gov. Doug Ducey,\u00a0Republican state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, and state Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert Brutinel in attendance. TRUMP PRESSES 'HAPLESS' REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA TO OVERULE SECRETARY OF STATE Hours after the certifying of the vote in Arizona, Wisconsin finalized their results, becoming the last of the remaining contested battleground states to do so. Biden was projected the winner in Arizona on Election Night by Fox News and The Associated Press. The other major news networks projected Biden as the winner in the state a week later. Biden ended up carrying the state by just over 10,000 votes, or three-tenths of 1 percent of the vote. Eleven electoral votes were up for grabs in Arizona. The former vice president became the first Democrat since President Bill Clinton in 1996 to carry Arizona, and only the third since President Harry Truman in 1948. In Wisconsin, state Elections Commission chair Ann Jacobs signed \"the official state determination of the results of the Nov. 3, 2020 election.\" The move, which confirmed Biden won Wisconsin by just over 20,000 votes, came a day after the completion of a partial recount requested by the Trump campaign. The recount slightly altered the results in Biden\u2019s favor. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers certified the election results later in the day. That kicked off a five-day window for the president to file a lawsuit in Wisconsin. On Saturday, Trump said he would bring a lawsuit in the state by Tuesday. The actions by both states are the latest setback for the president, who refuses to concede to Biden, more than three weeks after Fox News, the Associated Press and other news networks projected that Biden would win enough electoral votes to defeat Trump and become president-elect. Trump's legal team filed a spate of lawsuits in many of the key battlegrounds, in hopes of delaying the certification of the election, but the tactics have been unsuccessful to date. The recount in Wisconsin, as well as one requested by Trump in Georgia, also failed so far to alter Biden's victories. Trump's defeat in Arizona -- since the margin was greater than a tenth of 1 percent -- doesn't qualify for an automatic recount. While there's no provision in the state for a losing candidate to request a recount, Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward has indicated the state party will file a challenge to the results after they were certified. A lawsuit by the state GOP to force a hand recount of some ballots in Maricopa County, the state's largest, was dismissed on Nov. 19, due to no evidence of voter fraud. TRUMP BLASTS LEGAL SETBACKS TO HIS PUSH TO OVERTURN HIS ELECTION DEFEAT The top two attorneys steering Trump's legal efforts -- Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis -- appeared Monday in Phoenix with a group of GOP state lawmakers, for a \"fact-finding\" meeting to discuss potential fraud in the election. The two lawyers took part in a similar meeting last week in Pennsylvania, another state where Biden narrowly defeated the president. Pennsylvania, as well as the battlegrounds of Michigan, Nevada\u00a0and Georgia, have also certified their election results over the past week and a half. In his first interview since this month's election, Trump once again claimed that the \"election was a fraud; it was a rigged election.\" \"We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account,\" the president charged without backing up his claim, in a conversation with FOX\u00a0Business' Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But Trump also appeared to acknowledge that his legal bid to overturn the election results \"probably\" wouldn't reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has been the goal of his legal team.

    "article_text": "CNN reporter calls for Twitter to take censorship further, label Trump's account as disinformation Big Tech has been widely criticized for censoring conservatives and an overall liberal bias, but a hyper-partisan CNN reporter wants the social media platform to take censorship even further and slap labels on specific accounts. CNN media pundit Oliver Darcy, who regularly urges social media companies to de-platform people he disagrees with, wrote in CNN\u2019s media newsletter that Twitter needs to take significant steps to prevent President Trump from sharing misleading information. \u201cNearly every tweet from the president at this point is labeled for misinfo. Which had me thinking,\u201d Darcy wrote.\u00a0\u201cWhy doesn't Twitter just take the step of labeling his entire account as a known source of election disinfo? And why stop there? Why not label accounts that repeatedly spread claims the platform has to fact-check?\u201d FACEBOOK, TWITTER CEOS STRUGGLE TO NAME A SINGLE LIBERAL WHO HAS BEEN CENSORED ON THEIR PLATFORMS Darcy then suggested the hypothetical move would \u201chelp users weed out reliable sources from bad-faith actors,\u201d specifically from verified accounts. \u201cThink of it as a version of\u00a0NewsGuard\u00a0for Twitter,\u201d Darcy wrote, referring to the website that rates websites based on standards of credibility and transparency. MCENANY DISMISSES REPORTERS SHOUTING QUESTIONS DURING BRIEFING: 'I DON'T CALL ON ACTIVISTS' Media Research Center vice president Dan Gainor doesn\u2019t think other censorship advocates will be satisfied with Darcy\u2019s suggestion. \u201cCNN and the rest of the leftist media won't be happy until they silence any voice that dares disagree with them. Labeling accounts won't be considered strong enough by liberals in the press. Then they will want so-called \u2018misinformation\u2019 accounts limited and then shut down altogether,\u201d Gainor told Fox News. \u201cIf we actually labeled disinformation accounts, we'd have to hit most traditional media outlets, especially CNN,\u201d Gainor said before noting a 2017 incident when three CNN journalists who worked on a since-retracted story about Russia and a top Trump adviser left the network. Gainor feels that CNN\u2019s account would have a label if Darcy\u2019s suggestion was implemented by Twitter. \u201cThey pushed the bogus Russian conspiracy narrative to the point where CNN had to let go of three editorial employees,\u201d Gainor said. \u201cJournalists have become some of the worst censors on the internet \u2013 but only of conservative content.\u201d THREE JOURNALISTS QUIT CNN IN FALLOUT FROM RETRACTED RUSSIA STORY Darcy was once considered a\u00a0rising star of conservative media\u00a0and was even named to Red Alert Politics \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list of young,\u00a0right-leaning leaders\u00a0back in 2013. He began his career making online videos that exposed hypocrisy among liberal college students and eventually landed at Glenn Beck\u2019s The Blaze. In 2017, Darcy joined CNN as part of Brian Stelter\u2019s team of liberal media pundits and his public views quickly changed to mirror his far-left employer. CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper seems to agree with Darcy and tweeted on Monday that the problem isn\u2019t Twitter bias, but \u201cit\u2019s Trump lying.\u201d Meanwhile, Twitter has regularly labeled Trump tweets that feature disputed claims but the social media giant hasn\u2019t taken the same approach with others. Journalist Jeryl Bier noticed that a claim from a Chinese government spokesperson was recently condemned as false but managed to avoid Twitter\u2019s label. \u201cSo @Twitter can label a @realDonaldTrump tweet as suspect within minutes, but 14+ hours later, an official \u2018China Government Account\u2019 with a fake photo of a soldier executing a child is still up and unlabeled,\u201d Bier wrote.

    "article_text": "Trump presses 'hapless' Georgia governor to overrule secretary of state on signature matching President Trump called on Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to override Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on matching signatures during the state's recount, in a tweet Monday. Raffensperger has said that matching the signature on the outer envelope to the absentee ballot on the inside is impossible, because the ballots are separated from the envelopes when they are opened to protect voter privacy. The Trump campaign, which formally asked for a recount Nov. 22, says that \"without signature-matching, this recount would be a sham and again allow for illegal votes to be counted.\" Georgia certified President-elect Joe Biden as the winner on Nov. 20. \"Why won\u2019t Governor\u00a0@BrianKempGA, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes,\" Trump tweeted Monday. \"It will be a 'goldmine'\u00a0of fraud, and we will easily WIN the state.\" \"Also, quickly check the number of envelopes versus the number of ballots,\" he continued. \"You may just find that there are many more ballots than there are envelopes. So simple, and so easy to do. Georgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done!\" JUDGE HALTS 3 ATLANTA-AREA COUNTIES FROM ERASING DOMINION VOTING MACHINE DATA The tweets come a day after Trump told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that he is \"ashamed\" he endorsed Kemp during his 2018 race against Democrat Stacey Abrams. Georgia Sens. Kelly Loeffler\u00a0and David Perdue, two Republicans involved in runoff races, have backed the president's signature-matching demands and\u00a0called\u00a0for Raffensperger's resignation. But emergency rules that were adopted ahead of the presidential election explicitly require,\u00a0in order to\u00a0preserve the secrecy of each individual vote as laid out in Georgia law and the\u00a0Georgia Constitution, that ballots be separated from\u00a0their envelopes so\u00a0they cannot possibly be joined back together. GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE SOUNDS ALARM AHEAD OF RUNOFF ELECTIONS An emergency rule that was\u00a0adopted earlier this year\u00a0mandates that every absentee ballot goes through signature verification but that after the signature is verified the ballot itself is separated from the outer envelope with the signature. After the Trump criticism, Raffensperger said Monday that \"dishonest actors\" are spreading \"massive amounts of misinformation.\" \"There are those who are exploiting the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation, and frankly they are misleading the president as well apparently,\" he said during a Monday statement to reporters. \"We will continue to investigation credible claims of illegal voting and violation of state election law,\" he continued. \"There are currently over 250 open cases from 2020 and we have 23 investigators to follow up on that.\" In a Monday letter, the Trump campaign again asked Raffensperger to audit the signatures on absentee ballots and envelopes in all Georgia counties.

There was tremendous cheating here,\" Trump warned. \"If Republicans allow it to happen, you\u2019ll never have another Republican elected in the history of this country, at a Senate level or at a presidential level.\" The president on Friday\u00a0claimed\u00a0Biden\u00a0must prove that the votes he received in the\u00a0election were not \u201cillegally obtained\u201d in order to enter the White House. Trump\u2019s tweet came after Biden crossed the 80 million-vote threshold with ballots\u00a0still being counted, giving the former vice president a lead of more than 6 million votes. Fox News and other media outlets have projected that Biden has won the presidency. There is no requirement for Biden to \u201cprove\u201d his votes were legally obtained for him to take office.
