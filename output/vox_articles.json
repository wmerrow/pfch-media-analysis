    "h1": "A federal court just reinstated DACA, and the implications go far beyond immigration",

    "article_text": "A federal court just reinstated DACA, and the implications go far beyond immigration Late Friday afternoon, a federal district judge ordered the Trump administration to fully reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to live and work there.  The case is Batalla Vidal v. Wolf. Judge Nicholas Garaufis, who handed down the order, said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must \u201cpost a public notice, within 3 calendar days of this Order ... that it is accepting first-time requests for consideration of deferred action under DACA\u201d because the department\u2019s ostensible leader tried to limit the DACA program without having the authority to do so. The ruling is the latest blow to the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to end the program. In 2017, Trump\u2019s DHS issued a memo that sought to wind down the DACA program, but the Supreme Court ruled last June that DHS\u2019s initial attempts to end it were void because the department did not adequately explain why it was doing so. Rather than fully reinstating DACA following the Supreme Court\u2019s order, however, DHS issued a new memo in July signed by Undersecretary of Homeland Security\u2019s Office for Strategy, Policy, and Plans Chad Wolf \u2014 and the lawfulness of this July memo was the central issue in Batalla Vidal. \u201cI have concluded that the DACA policy, at a minimum, presents serious policy concerns that may warrant its full rescission,\u201d Wolf wrote in that memo.  The memo directs \u201cDHS personnel to take all appropriate actions to reject all pending and future initial requests for DACA,\u201d and it provides that current DACA beneficiaries may only receive one-year renewals of their DACA status, rather than the two-year extensions they would have received prior to this memo. Wolf, moreover, purported to be far more than a mere undersecretary in his memorandum. In November of 2019, President Trump named Wolf acting Secretary of Homeland Security, and Wolf signed his July memo as \u201cActing Secretary.\u201d This distinction matters because as undersecretary, Wolf lacks the power to make changes to DACA, but the Secretary of Homeland Security does have the authority to make such changes. Judge Garaufis ruled in mid-November that Wolf \u201cwas not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security under the Homeland Security Act (\u2018HSA\u2019) when he issued the July 28, 2020 memorandum,\u201d thereby cutting the legs out from under Wolf\u2019s attempt to water down the DACA program. If Wolf is not the acting secretary, then his July memo is void. The order Garaufis handed down on Friday lays out some of the consequences of the judge\u2019s mid-November decision. \u201cBecause Mr. Wolf was without lawful authority to serve as Acting Secretary of OHS, the Wolf Memorandum is VACATED,\u201d Garaufis wrote in his most recent order. So the good news for DACA-eligible immigrants is that, barring a decision from a higher court blocking Garaufis\u2019s most recent order, those immigrants will soon be able to obtain DACA status. And even if the order is blocked, President-elect Joe Biden has also pledged to fully reinstate DACA once he takes office on January 20. Nevertheless, the future of DACA remains uncertain. For one thing, the Supreme Court\u2019s June decision blocking the Trump administration\u2019s initial attempts to end the program was a  5-4 decision, with the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the majority. Since then, Trump has replaced Ginsburg with the far more conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett. And even before Barrett arrived at the Supreme Court, several members of the Court had signaled that they thought DACA is illegal. So there\u2019s a reasonable likelihood that the Court\u2019s new 6-3 Republican majority will strike down the DACA program even as Biden tries to preserve it. The logic of Garaufis\u2019s November opinion \u2014 that presidents have only limited authority to make acting appointments \u2014 could also come back to bite Biden, especially if Republicans control the Senate and, with it, the power to block Biden\u2019s nominees. The core issue in the Batalla Vidal case turns on whether Wolf was lawfully appointed acting secretary, and therefore is empowered to make changes to the DACA program. Garaufis\u2019s opinion holding that Wolf was not lawfully appointed is fairly straightforward. The Homeland Security Act provides that, if DHS\u2019s top job becomes vacant, the deputy secretary shall act as secretary. If both jobs are vacant, then \u201cthe Under Secretary for Management shall serve as the Acting Secretary if by reason of absence, disability, or vacancy in office, neither the Secretary nor Deputy Secretary is available to exercise the duties of the Office of the Secretary.\u201d A sitting secretary, moreover, \u201cmay designate such other officers of the Department in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.\u201d Currently, DHS\u2019s top ranks are a bit a of ghost town. All three of the top jobs are vacant. Kirstjen Nielsen, the last person to serve as a Senate-confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security, resigned in April of 2019. Before she left, however, she did lay out the order of succession that should apply if the top three jobs at DHS became vacant. If all top three jobs were vacant, Nielsen determined, then the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency should become secretary \u2014 but this job has been vacant since the spring of 2019. Next in line would be the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) \u2014 a job that, until recently, was filled by Christopher Krebs.  Trump fired Krebs in mid-November after Krebs refuted false claims by Trump and some of Trump\u2019s allies that Biden somehow stole the 2020 election. But Krebs still was in his job as head of CISA in July, when Wolf handed down his DACA memo. That means that Krebs, not Wolf, should have been the acting secretary in July. It\u2019s worth noting that, even with Krebs out of the picture, Wolf still is not next in line to be acting secretary. After Krebs is the DHS\u2019s undersecretary for science and technology, but this position is vacant and the job is currently being done by a \u201cSenior Official Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary for Science and Technology.\u201d The next person in line after that is the undersecretary for intelligence and analysis, but that position is vacant as well, and the relevant office is held by an acting official. Eighth in line is the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, but that position is also vacant and there, too, the office is led by an acting official. Ninth in line is the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration. The TSA actually does have a Senate-confirmed leader \u2014 David Pekoske was confirmed to lead the TSA in 2017 \u2014 and he still holds that office. So it would appear that Pekoske, not Wolf, should currently be serving as acting secretary of DHS. As this litany of vacant offices and acting officials suggests, the courts have thus far been fairly tolerant of President Trump\u2019s attempts to bypass the Senate and fill top jobs with acting officials. But Judge Garaufis\u2019s order suggests that tolerance may be coming to an end just as Biden is preparing to take office. We do not yet know who will control the Senate at the beginning of the Biden administration. Currently, Republicans hold a 50-48 seat majority in the incoming Senate, with two seats to be determined in a January 5 Georgia runoff election.  If Democrats win both of those seats, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris\u2019s tiebreaking vote will give them a narrow majority in the Senate. But if Republicans prevail in either Georgia race, then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) will continue to lead the Senate, and Republicans will have the power to block any Biden nominee to any Senate-confirmed job. Biden, meanwhile, may find himself unable to staff his administration if Republicans choose to sabotage his presidency. While the Department of Homeland Security has a rigid order of succession for its top job, most agencies are governed by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act   (FVRA) when a Senate-confirmed position becomes vacant.  Under the FVRA, the president may temporarily fill a vacant, Senate-confirmed job with an acting appointee. But the president cannot fill the job with just anyone \u2014 typically the acting appointee must either be currently serving in a Senate-confirmed job, or be currently serving as a senior civil servant. Thus, if a vacancy arises in the middle of a presidency, that\u2019s typically no big deal. After the first year of a new presidency, the president will normally have appointed hundreds of individuals to Senate-confirmed jobs. So that gives the president a deep bench of officials to slide into acting roles as they are needed. But, at the beginning of Biden\u2019s presidency, he won\u2019t be able to rely on existing Senate-confirmed officials to serve as acting secretaries if the Senate refuses to confirm his nominees. With rare exceptions, the only people in Senate-confirmed jobs when Biden takes office will be Trump appointees.  Biden could potentially fill the vacant jobs with civil servants \u2014 that is, with senior career officials in the relevant agencies \u2014 but that could prevent Biden from naming a Cabinet that shares his political and policy vision. The FVRA imposes rigid limits on just how long an individual may serve in an acting role. Under many circumstances, the tenure of an acting official is limited to just 210 days after a vacancy arises. So even though Biden could fill many jobs temporarily with civil servants, many of those acting appointments will expire just seven months into his presidency. As mentioned above, the courts haven\u2019t exactly been rigorous in enforcing these restrictions under President Trump, but they now seem likely to take a new interest in enforcing laws like the FVRA once Biden takes office. A 6-3 Republican Supreme Court is unlikely to bend the law in order to help a Democratic president \u2014 and really, the law is quite clear that Biden does not have a limitless power to make acting appointments. A tremendous amount, in other words, is potentially at stake in the Georgia Senate runoffs. Those races could determine whether the Biden administration is able to perform many of the most basic functions of government \u2014 starting with actually getting people into top jobs within the administration.",

    "h1": "The Trump-backed opposition leader in Venezuela is likely to lose his power",
    "first_p": "",
    "article_text": "The Trump-backed opposition leader in Venezuela is likely to lose his power  The Venezuelan politician President Donald Trump backed to depose and replace that country\u2019s dictator is poised to lose his position of power \u2014 making it harder for him to make his leadership claim and driving a stake into the heart of one of the Trump administration\u2019s signature foreign policies.  In January 2019, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared himself the country\u2019s rightful president. He argued that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has been in power for seven years, rigged the 2018 presidential election that kept him in charge and that, as a result, Guaid\u00f3, as the head of the National Assembly, was the rightful interim president of the country according to the country\u2019s constitution. The United States and more than 50 other countries backed Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim and have been working ever since to help him push Maduro out once and for all. They\u2019ve sanctioned politicians and businesses, sent much-needed food and medical aid, and helped sustain a global campaign to back Guaid\u00f3 and boost his popularity. But despite the two-year push, Guaid\u00f3 has remained in the National Assembly and Maduro in the president\u2019s mansion. Come Sunday, though, only Maduro likely will get to stay where he is. Venezuelans will head to the polls Sunday to vote in the country\u2019s National Assembly elections, where they\u2019ll determine the 277 people to represent them starting on January 5.  But Guaid\u00f3 and his opposition faction are boycotting the polls because they say the election is rigged.  They have a strong argument, especially since international observers from the European Union and the United Nations won\u2019t be watching. Plus, government security forces have blocked the opposition from entering the Legislative Palace to participate in National Assembly sessions since January \u2014 right when the body was set to reelect Guaid\u00f3 as its leader. Since then, Guaid\u00f3 and his allies have held their own parallel sessions of parliament outside of the institution. Even if they\u2019re in the right \u2014 and polls indicate many Venezuelans agree with their claims \u2014 it still means Guaid\u00f3 and his faction will likely lose their seats in the next National Assembly. That would deal the opposition a huge blow and deliver Maduro a significant victory. \u201cThe future of Guaid\u00f3\u2019s project looks grim,\u201d said David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America human rights group. \u201cThere is less international consensus on the status of Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the interim presidency after January 5.\u201d \u201cIt is likely that he will retain support but it will be less robust, and the whole Venezuela issue will be put on the back burner in the US and the EU,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe next two months will likely see a worsening of Guaid\u00f3\u2019s position that will lead to a slow degradation of his power and a slow consolidation for Maduro during 2021.\u201d Sunday\u2019s likely rigged election will represent an immense loss for what remains of Venezuela\u2019s democracy and effectively complete Maduro\u2019s authoritarian takeover of the economically devastated nation.  The National Assembly\u2019s December 2015 vote was seen as the country\u2019s last legitimate election. Since then, Maduro has put more and more of the nation\u2019s government under his boot, and he\u2019s now on the verge of claiming his final prize. With Venezuela\u2019s legislative body filled with the dictator\u2019s cronies, Maduro will have subverted the entire government to his will. Guaid\u00f3 will still have some ability to fight back. President-elect Joe Biden and leaders in other countries have vowed to support his cause, and he controls a large segment of the country\u2019s financial assets, including the Venezuelan Central Bank\u2019s accounts in the US, the oil company Citgo, and gold in the Bank of England.  The problem, experts say, is that this influence is more external than internal. Once he\u2019s officially out of the National Assembly, Guaid\u00f3 and his allies won\u2019t be able to stop contracts and agreements Maduro wants to sign with world powers like China and Russia for resource extraction or laws Maduro wants to pass that could curtail civil society and pro-democracy groups, experts say.  Maduro, then, found a way to ensure his reign over the last few years. And after Sunday, his seat on the throne almost surely will be secured.  ",

    "article_text": "A new Georgia poll suggests that Republican lies about \u201cvoter fraud\u201d are hurting the GOP Let\u2019s start this piece with some appropriate caveats about polling in general. 2020 was not a great year for the polling industry. Many polls, especially in Midwestern states and in Maine, vastly overestimated Democratic performance. The polls predicted that Joe Biden would win the presidential race, and he did, but he had comfortable polling leads in several states that turned out to be much closer. That said, pollsters in Georgia did a pretty good job with the presidential and Senate races. The FiveThirtyEight polling average predicted that Biden would win the state by 1.2 points. He wound up winning by 0.2 points. So the polls were only off by 1 percentage point, and close in the initial Senate races, too. That suggests that Georgia polling is more reliable than the polls in many other states. Which brings us to a new SurveyUSA poll looking at the January 5 runoff elections in Georgia, which will decide which party controls the United States Senate (SurveyUSA is an \u201cA\u201d rated pollster, according to FiveThirtyEight). The topline in this poll is that Democrat Raphael Warnock leads appointed Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler by a 52-45 margin. Meanwhile, Democrat Jon Ossoff leads incumbent Republican Sen. David Purdue by a smaller 50-48 margin.  This poll is just one snapshot of the race. But if Democrats do win both seats, the incoming Senate would be evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, which means that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would hold the tie-breaking vote and Sen. Chuck Schumer would be majority leader (though Republicans would likely still be able to filibuster most legislation). One interesting thing about the SurveyUSA poll is that it offers a window into whether Republican turnout is likely to drop because of efforts by President Trump and his allies to diminish confidence in US elections. Briefly, the poll suggests that a small but significant number of Georgia Republicans do plan to sit out the election due to those efforts \u2014 enough to potentially flip these races to Warnock and Ossoff. Even before many outlets had called the 2020 race for Biden, Trump and his allies started touting evidence-free claims that Trump only lost because of widespread voter fraud. Trump campaign lawyers and lawyers aligned with the campaign also filed a series of meritless lawsuits challenging the election results or seeking to prevent states from certifying Biden\u2019s victory. These lawsuits have accomplished little, if anything. Trump has also attacked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp, both of whom are Republicans, for supposedly enabling voter fraud in that state. Again, there is no evidence that such fraud exists. Some of Trump\u2019s allies have even gone so far as to urge Republicans to boycott the Georgia runoff elections. At a rally in Atlanta this week, for example, former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell said that she \u201cwould encourage all Georgians to make it known that you will not vote at all until your vote is secure.\u201d These attempts to undermine confidence in the Georgia runoff elections appear to be having an effect. The SurveyUSA poll interviewed a total of 717 registered voters, 118 of whom said they are not likely to vote in the runoff. Of these likely non-voters, 13 percent said they planned not to vote because \u201cthe voting process is rigged.\u201d Another 5 percent said they are \u201cintentionally boycotting the runoff.\u201d To be clear, 118 respondents is a very small sample size, so no one should take these figures as gospel. But there\u2019s other evidence that Republicans are more likely to sit out the January 5 runoffs than Democrats. As data journalist Nate Silver notes, the poll suggests that the January electorate could be 3 to 4 points more Democratic than the voters who turned out in November. In other words, if Warnock and Ossoff do prevail next month, they could have Trump and Trump allies like Sidney Powell to thank for their victory. Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine confidence in the election are likely to be ignored by Democrats, but they appear to be resonating with at least some Republicans.  And in two close elections, if even a small fraction of Republicans decide that their votes won\u2019t matter, that could swing both races to Democrats.",

    "article_text": "Federal watchdog says \u201csubstantial likelihood of wrongdoing\u201d at US broadcasting agency In June, a Steve Bannon ally and conservative filmmaker appointed by President Donald Trump took over running the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), a vast international network of news agencies funded and operated by the US government. Within hours of introducing himself to employees, the new CEO, Michael Pack, purged four top officials. He then went on to ban visas for certain foreign reporters and began investigating journalists at the agency for suspected anti-Trump bias. In October, he announced he was eliminating the agency\u2019s regulatory \u201cfirewall\u201d \u2014 longstanding internal policies aimed at protecting the editorial independence of journalists at the agency from political interference from the government. Critics accused Pack of abusing his power to turn America\u2019s state-run news organizations, whose mission is to disseminate factual, unbiased news to people who live in countries where freedom of the press is either strongly curtailed or nonexistent, into Trump-friendly propaganda outlets. While Pack and his team haven\u2019t achieved a pro-Trump project, a federal watchdog has found accusations of gross mismanagement to be credible. In letters to 11 whistleblowers on Wednesday night, the US Office of Special Counsel (OSC) \u2014 an investigative and prosecutorial government body \u2014 revealed that it had found \u201ca substantial likelihood of wrongdoing\u201d at the USAGM, which oversees four media organizations: Voice of America, Middle East Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. With help from the Government Accountability Project (GAP), which represents more than 20 current and former staffers at the USAGM, 11 whistleblowers sent specific complaints to the OSC over the last few months. They included allegations that USAGM leadership \u201crepeatedly violated the Voice of America (VOA) firewall\u201d and \u201cengaged in gross mismanagement and abuse of authority.\u201d Further, the whistleblowers claimed leadership \u201cpressured career staff to illegally repurpose \u2026 congressionally appropriated funds and programs without notifying Congress.\u201d On Wednesday evening, the OSC replied to these and other allegations, noting that what the whistleblowers alleged seemed to be true. \u201cOSC has found a substantial likelihood of wrongdoing based on the information you submitted in support of your allegations,\u201d wrote Karen Tanenbaum, an attorney with OSC\u2019s  Retaliation and Disclosure Unit. However, OSC gives any offending agency \u2014 in this case, UASGM \u2014 60 days to conduct its own probe and respond to the complaints. It\u2019s not until that investigation ends that OSC makes a final determination. \u201cThis remains an open matter under investigation until the agency\u2019s final report is forwarded to the President and Congress,\u201d Tanenbaum concluded. Still, GAP senior counsel David Seide, who represents the whistleblowers, believes the letters signal an early victory for his clients. \u201cThe conduct by [USAGM] is shocking, and we\u2019re glad an independent agency agrees with us,\u201d Seide told me in an interview. It\u2019s unclear whether Pack and other agency leaders will face any real penalties while in office, though. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to fire Pack, and the 60 days that USAGM has to respond exceeds the remaining time until Biden\u2019s inauguration. It\u2019s therefore likely that Pack and his team will leave government before receiving any reprimands. But Seide and his clients feel this is more than just misbehavior on Pack\u2019s part. This is about protecting the culture of an agency with the tough task of reporting news independently and fiercely while on the federal payroll. \u201cThere\u2019s an accounting to be done here for lessons learned,\u201d said Seide. \u201cThis is very much a work in progress.\u201d What may come out of all this, then, is a bunch of congressional hearings on how best to oversee the USAGM and a tough Senate confirmation battle over who Biden selects to replace Pack. In the interim, the whistleblowers sense imminent victory. \u201cWe\u2019re all very encouraged by the OSC response and hope USAGM will take it seriously,\u201d a whistleblower, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for privacy reasons, told me.",

    "article_text": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s bizarre legal strategy, in two clips  \u201cWhat\u2019d you guys do \u2014 take it and do something crazy to it?\u201d That\u2019s just one of many absurd claims in a clip that has reached more than 13 million views already, where Melissa Carone \u2014 one of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s star witnesses at a hearing where he asked Michigan legislators to overturn the state\u2019s presidential election results \u2014 veers from accusation to accusation. In a testy exchange, Carone accuses Republican state representatives of tampering with state voting records when one official tells her the poll book is not off by 30,000 votes.  The exchange is comically hard to follow, but it\u2019s illustrative of the sputtering, slapdash, and conspiracy theory-driven nature of Trumpworld\u2019s flailing attempts to discredit and overturn the results of the 2020 election. Carone\u2019s testimony was part of a hearing scheduled on December 1 when Michigan House Oversight Chair Matt Hall (R) invited Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to \u201cspeak to the committee on election irregularities in Michigan.\u201d Hall said in his statement that he was hoping for \u201cclarity and transparency.\u201d  That\u2019s not what Michigan got.  According to MLive, the Trump legal team mostly spent their time calling up Michigan Republicans to testify against the election process in Wayne County. Many of them rehashed baseless claims of voter fraud and misconduct \u201cmade at a Senate Oversight Committee hearing Tuesday and in affidavits included in various legal challenges to the election results ... none of those challenges have been successful in court.\u201d This hearing came two days after Attorney General Bill Barr told the Associated Press that there was no proof that widespread voter fraud could have altered the result of the 2020 presidential election. Michigan Republicans did not allow testimony under oath, restricted Democrats from calling witnesses, and prohibited cross-examination, leading Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to call the hearings a \u201cstate sponsored disinformation campaign geared toward undermining our electoral system.\u201d Carone\u2019s testimony was, if not emblematic, at least fairly in step with the rest of the hearing. Her testimony went too far for even Giuliani, who at one point leaned over, seemingly to try to restrain his witness after she laughed derisively at a request to stop interrupting the official asking her to clarify her claims of fraud. It\u2019s unclear what Giuliani expected \u2014 Carone\u2019s accusations had been aired on Fox when she was interviewed on November 11. In the interview with Lou Dobbs, she insinuated that vans providing food to poll workers were in fact carrying illegitimate votes instead. Days later, a Wayne County judge stated that these allegations \u201csimply are not credible,\u201d according to reporting by the Washington Post.  Multiple witnesses focused their criticisms on Detroit, a city that is 79 percent Black and that Giuliani referred to as \u201ccorrupt,\u201d saying \u201cdon\u2019t scratch your head about what happens in Detroit. They steal elections in Detroit.\u201d  MLive reported that Detroit activists have been alarmed by the Trump campaign\u2019s claims of voter fraud in their city. Activist Branden Snyder told MLive that it \u201creeks of racism ... that Black folks and in a majority-Black city can\u2019t count their own votes.\u201d Nessel echoed these claims, saying \u201cthe themes we see, that persist here, are this: Black people are corrupt, Black people are incompetent, and Black people can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, one Michigan woman used racist language to argue in favor of instituting a voter ID requirement.  Accusations of voter fraud are inextricable from the long history of restricting the right of people of color to vote. A January brief published by the Brennan Center for Justice explains: Of course, Michigan does have a voter ID requirement. You have to present a valid form of identification or sign an affidavit. In the November 2016 election, only around 18,000 people opted to sign an affidavit instead of providing identification, according to Bridge Michigan, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news source. President-elect Joe Biden received over 150,000 more votes than Trump in the state.  One Republican official\u2019s reaction to the hearing pretty much sums it up \u2014 state Rep. Aaron Miller castigated Giuliani, telling the Detroit News: \u201cHe made wild and broad partisan insults for several minutes that had nothing to do with the election, and it was frankly unacceptable, shameful, and pathetic and distracts from any evidence that we might hear. I\u2019m utterly embarrassed.\u201d ",

    "article_text": "A new Georgia poll suggests that Republican lies about \u201cvoter fraud\u201d are hurting the GOP Let\u2019s start this piece with some appropriate caveats about polling in general. 2020 was not a great year for the polling industry. Many polls, especially in Midwestern states and in Maine, vastly overestimated Democratic performance. The polls predicted that Joe Biden would win the presidential race, and he did, but he had comfortable polling leads in several states that turned out to be much closer. That said, pollsters in Georgia did a pretty good job with the presidential and Senate races. The FiveThirtyEight polling average predicted that Biden would win the state by 1.2 points. He wound up winning by 0.2 points. So the polls were only off by 1 percentage point, and close in the initial Senate races, too. That suggests that Georgia polling is more reliable than the polls in many other states. Which brings us to a new SurveyUSA poll looking at the January 5 runoff elections in Georgia, which will decide which party controls the United States Senate (SurveyUSA is an \u201cA\u201d rated pollster, according to FiveThirtyEight). The topline in this poll is that Democrat Raphael Warnock leads appointed Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler by a 52-45 margin. Meanwhile, Democrat Jon Ossoff leads incumbent Republican Sen. David Purdue by a smaller 50-48 margin.  This poll is just one snapshot of the race. But if Democrats do win both seats, the incoming Senate would be evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, which means that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would hold the tie-breaking vote and Sen. Chuck Schumer would be majority leader (though Republicans would likely still be able to filibuster most legislation). One interesting thing about the SurveyUSA poll is that it offers a window into whether Republican turnout is likely to drop because of efforts by President Trump and his allies to diminish confidence in US elections. Briefly, the poll suggests that a small but significant number of Georgia Republicans do plan to sit out the election due to those efforts \u2014 enough to potentially flip these races to Warnock and Ossoff. Even before many outlets had called the 2020 race for Biden, Trump and his allies started touting evidence-free claims that Trump only lost because of widespread voter fraud. Trump campaign lawyers and lawyers aligned with the campaign also filed a series of meritless lawsuits challenging the election results or seeking to prevent states from certifying Biden\u2019s victory. These lawsuits have accomplished little, if anything. Trump has also attacked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp, both of whom are Republicans, for supposedly enabling voter fraud in that state. Again, there is no evidence that such fraud exists. Some of Trump\u2019s allies have even gone so far as to urge Republicans to boycott the Georgia runoff elections. At a rally in Atlanta this week, for example, former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell said that she \u201cwould encourage all Georgians to make it known that you will not vote at all until your vote is secure.\u201d These attempts to undermine confidence in the Georgia runoff elections appear to be having an effect. The SurveyUSA poll interviewed a total of 717 registered voters, 118 of whom said they are not likely to vote in the runoff. Of these likely non-voters, 13 percent said they planned not to vote because \u201cthe voting process is rigged.\u201d Another 5 percent said they are \u201cintentionally boycotting the runoff.\u201d To be clear, 118 respondents is a very small sample size, so no one should take these figures as gospel. But there\u2019s other evidence that Republicans are more likely to sit out the January 5 runoffs than Democrats. As data journalist Nate Silver notes, the poll suggests that the January electorate could be 3 to 4 points more Democratic than the voters who turned out in November. In other words, if Warnock and Ossoff do prevail next month, they could have Trump and Trump allies like Sidney Powell to thank for their victory. Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine confidence in the election are likely to be ignored by Democrats, but they appear to be resonating with at least some Republicans.  And in two close elections, if even a small fraction of Republicans decide that their votes won\u2019t matter, that could swing both races to Democrats.",

    "first_p": "",
    "article_text": "The high rate of executions during Trump\u2019s last weeks in office, explained   When five Black and Latino teenagers were wrongfully convicted of the rape of a jogger in New York City\u2019s Central Park in 1989, prominent businessman Donald Trump bought newspaper advertisements calling on New York state to \u201cbring back the death penalty\u201d in the wake of the attack. Little did the country know, Trump\u2019s views on capital punishment then would inform his presidency decades later: In July, the Trump administration reinstated the death penalty at the federal level after a 17-year hiatus. The return of federal executions demonstrates an unprecedented and grim picture of Trump\u2019s legacy in contrast to previous administrations. The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board described it as a \u201csickening spree of executions.\u201d To put it in perspective, only three people had been executed by the federal government in the past 50 years. Meanwhile, in less than five months, eight people have already been put to death by Trump\u2019s Justice Department, with five more executions scheduled to happen before Trump leaves office.  \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s policy regarding a death penalty is just historically abhorrent,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of Death Penalty Information Center, a bipartisan organization that does not take a position for or against the death penalty, but rather is critical of the way capital punishment is administered.  If the remaining executions in December are carried out \u2014 making a total of 10 for 2020 \u2014 it will mark more civilian executions in a single calendar year than any other presidency in the 20th and 21st centuries. \u201cNo one has conducted this number of federal civilian executions in this short period of time in American history,\u201d Dunham added. Of the five upcoming federal executions during the lame-duck period, four of them are Black men, while the fifth will be the first woman to be executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. These federal executions come in concert with the rallying cry for racial justice and an overhaul of America\u2019s policing and criminal justice systems that has left a disproportionate number of Black people arrested, jailed, convicted, and dead. More than 44 percent of the remaining 54 people on federal death row are Black, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, even though Black people make up only 13 percent of the US population.  \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re having a record-high number of federal executions, at the same time that we\u2019re near a record low in state executions, in the middle of a pandemic, shows how much the Trump administration is either out of touch or that it cannot resist gratuitous acts of cruelty,\u201d Dunham said, adding that only seven state executions will occur this year \u2014 the lowest since states began carrying out executions in colonial times. \u201cNobody needs to carry out an execution during a pandemic.\u201d Just last week, the Justice Department also published a rule that would allow other methods for capital punishment, such as firing squads, lethal gas, and electrocutions; Attorney General Bill Barr is currently racing to finalize that rule. Trump\u2019s push for additional methods and a number of federal executions will be part of his presidential legacy and highlights a stark divide between the administration\u2019s actions and dwindling support for the death penalty among Americans. On November 19, Orlando Hall, a Black man sentenced to death for kidnapping, rape, and murder in 1994, became the eighth and latest inmate to be executed by the federal government since it reinstated federal executions this summer. He is also the first in more than a century to be put to death during a lame-duck period. Shortly before Hall was executed by lethal injection, the US Supreme Court had denied his request to stop the execution \u2014 with new Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the majority ruling.  While Hall is the second Black man to be executed out of the eight so far since July, the remaining men scheduled to be put to death are all Black. \u201cIn an apparent effort to forestall criticism that the federal executions were racist, the administration selected white prisoners first,\u201d Dunham said; the executions were reinstated as racial justice protests broke out across the country this summer. \u201cWhat\u2019s striking about that, though, is that it still tells us a lot about whose lives matter because only one of the people executed so far was convicted for killing an African American.\u201d Brandon Bernard, convicted of kidnapping and murder, is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on December 10. Bernard, who is also Black, was only 18 years old when he committed crimes that resulted in the deaths of a young white married couple in 1999. But five of the nine surviving jurors who supported the death penalty at the time now believe it is inappropriate. Even Angela Moore, the federal prosecutor who helped put Bernard on death row, wrote an op-ed in the Indianapolis Star making a case for why the federal government should let him live. \u201cI always took pride in representing the United States as a federal prosecutor, and I think executing Brandon would be a terrible stain on the nation\u2019s honor,\u201d Moore wrote.  During his time in prison, Bernard has been a model prisoner, mentoring at-risk youth. \u201cHaving learned so much since 2000 about the maturation of the human brain and having seen Brandon grow into a humble, remorseful adult fully capable of living peacefully in prison, how can we say he is among that tiny group of offenders who must be put to death?\u201d Moore wrote.  Alfred Bourgeois, a Black truck driver in Texas who was convicted of abusing and killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2002, is scheduled for execution the day after Bernard. Bourgeois\u2019s execution was originally scheduled for January 2020 but was halted by a federal judge who blocked the Trump administration\u2019s early moves to bring back the federal death penalty. Bourgeois\u2019s lawyers then argued to suspend his death sentence on the grounds that he\u2019s entitled to an intellectual disability evaluation under the Eighth Amendment.  The next two inmates on death row are scheduled for execution in 2021 just a few days before Biden\u2019s inauguration. Cory Johnson, who was convicted of murdering seven people during a drug trafficking operation in Richmond, Virginia, is scheduled for lethal injection on January 14. Like Bourgeois, Johnson\u2019s lawyers argue that there is overwhelming evidence that Johnson has intellectual disabilities.  On January 15, Dustin Higgs is scheduled to be put to death for a crime committed in 1996. The Justice Department claims that Higgs kidnapped and murdered three women, but the Daily Beast reports that while he was present at the scene of the crime, witnesses confirm that Higgs did not kill anyone. Co-defendant Willis Haynes fired the shots, but the Justice Department argues that Higgs coerced his friend Haynes into committing the crime.  But Haynes, who was sentenced to life in prison, confirmed through a signed affidavit that Higgs did not coerce him, saying, \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s theory of our case was bullshit. Dustin didn\u2019t threaten me. I was not scared of him. Dustin didn\u2019t make me do anything that night or ever.\u201d The other person on the Justice Department\u2019s execution schedule is Lisa Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row and the first woman set to be federally executed in nearly 70 years. In 2004, Montgomery killed a pregnant woman and then attempted to pass off the baby as her own. Montgomery, who Dunham said has severe mental illness due to an abusive past, was initially scheduled for execution by lethal injection on December 8, but it was delayed due to her lawyers contracting Covid-19.  Trump is the first president in 17 years to reinstate federal executions, despite a recent poll showing that a record-low number of Americans consider the death penalty \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d Even across party lines, the death penalty has been a historically contentious issue. Since the US Supreme Court revived capital punishment in 1976, state governments have been doing most executions, though those have declined in the past two decades, too.  In addition to pushing through federal executions over the past five months, the Justice Department published a new rule to the Federal Register on Friday that would allow the use of other methods for capital punishment. The new regulation reintroduces the use of firing squads and electrocutions for federal executions in addition to lethal injections. The new rule is set to go into effect in 30 days instead of the generally allotted 60 days. As it stands for the remaining inmates awaiting execution, only Higgs appears not to have a method of execution stated on the Justice Department\u2019s schedule \u2014 the rest are marked for lethal injection. The Trump administration\u2019s move, among many others, is another thing President-elect Biden \u2014 who has signaled at various times that he would end the federal death penalty \u2014 will have to face once in office. Biden, a political veteran, has repeatedly addressed criticism during his presidential campaign over the role he played in passing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, also known as the 1994 crime bill, signed by President Bill Clinton. The bill allowed the expansion of crimes eligible for the federal death penalty, which aided the conviction of some of the inmates now awaiting execution. (Hall was only eligible for the death penalty because the crime bill added kidnapping resulting in death to the list of crimes.) The Trump administration is trying to cut corners and fast-track dozens of rules that range from oil-drilling in the Arctic to immigrant restrictions, as well as the death penalty rule, before Biden takes over. If the rules are finalized, the new administration would have to go through a convoluted process to roll them back. But since Biden has pledged to abolish the death penalty at the federal level and incentivize states to follow the federal government\u2019s example, the new death penalty rule may virtually not be of use in his administration.  \u201cUnlike the environmental regulations or policies making it more difficult to negotiate on trade or world safety, the Biden administration can take as much time as it wants to undo this regulation,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cUndoing it isn\u2019t that difficult. I believe the regulation is intended to make it easier for the Trump administration to carry out the remaining lame-duck executions.\u201d The bigger question is how Biden\u2019s administration will transform a historically racist criminal justice system while also healing the wounds brought by the Trump administration.  \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s conduct, when it comes to criminal legal issues, has been highly political, and mostly out of step with the direction that most of the United States is heading,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cWhen push came to shove, it reverted to policies that are more extreme in their cruelty and the arbitrariness of their application than anything else we have seen in modern American history.\u201d  The Trump administration\u2019s push for federal executions, while the country has been preoccupied with the election and the pandemic, is no different.

    "article_text": "The past 24 hours in Trump\u2019s legal issues and pardon news, explained President Donald Trump, over the last 24 hours, has made one thing abundantly clear: His final few weeks in office will not be lacking in the legal drama and corruption concerns that have pervaded his presidency. After having already pardoned his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Trump has been discussing potential broad preemptive pardons for his children Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka; his son-in-law Jared Kushner; and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, per reporting from ABC News and the New York Times. None of these people has been charged with any crime, so these pardons would have to entail sweeping assertions of impunity. Meanwhile, a newly released, heavily redacted court opinion revealed that federal investigators have been probing an alleged corrupt scheme to provide political contributions (apparently to the Trump campaign or Republican groups, but we don\u2019t know the specifics) in exchange for a presidential pardon from Trump. The identities of the people involved in this matter are redacted, but the news makes clear that even before Trump lost, matters involving his pardon power have been under investigative scrutiny. Also on Tuesday, Attorney General Bill Barr returned to the headlines after a quiet period. Barr told the Associated Press that the Justice Department has \u201cnot seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d Perhaps to soften the blow to President Donald Trump\u2019s hopes from this admission, Barr also revealed that he has appointed John Durham \u2014 the US attorney investigating the conduct of the FBI\u2019s Trump campaign/Russia probe \u2014 as a special counsel, to make it more difficult for Biden to fire him. (Barr spent more than two hours at the White House Tuesday afternoon.) All in all, Trump is continuing to try to bend law enforcement agencies to his will \u2014 but having limited success of late. So he\u2019s being increasingly drawn to the pardon power, which he can exercise on his own authority, to save his close associates and family members from possible legal consequences. Around midday Tuesday, I wrote about how \u201cTrump\u2019s pardon shenanigans are ramping up,\u201d because his recent pardon for Flynn contained preemptive aspects, and because he was reportedly discussing a similarly preemptive pardon for his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. But the news of the day wasn\u2019t done. The New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman and Michael Schmidt later reported that Trump has also talked with advisers about potentially granting preemptive pardons to his three eldest children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump \u2014 as well as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The business dealings of both the Trump Organization and the Kushner family have come under investigative scrutiny, and Donald Jr.\u2019s meeting with a Russian lawyer to try and get dirt on Hillary Clinton was also scrutinized as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe.  But none of these have resulted in any criminal charges against Trump\u2019s children or Kushner. So any hypothetical pardon would have to be quite broadly written and preemptive. (It also could not cover state crimes, which could be a problem, as the major Trump Organization investigation is being pursued by New York state prosecutors.) It would also, of course, be a stunning and unprecedented use of executive power for a president to grant broad immunity from federal criminal prosecution to his children. Some Trump allies, like Fox News host Sean Hannity, are arguing that the move would be justified because they expect prosecutors under Biden to pursue a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d of people close to Trump.  Yet if Trump \u2014 or his children \u2014 have political ambitions in 2024, that might present an incentive to hold back on the broadest possible uses of the pardon power.  Just as Trump has been turning more attention to how far he wants to go in using his pardon power, news broke that federal investigators are already looking into what they view as a corrupt effort to get such a pardon from Trump. The revelation came from a newly unsealed court opinion by Beryl Howell, the chief judge of the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The opinion is heavily redacted, though, so we are missing key details, including the identities of the people involved in this purported scheme. But there\u2019s a fair amount we can piece together from the unredacted bits. The gist is that investigators say there are two separate schemes aimed at getting a certain person a pardon or sentence reduction.  Investigators uncovered these two purported schemes while reviewing material seized in the course of a preexisting investigation. But there was one issue: One of the people involved in lobbying the White House was a lawyer. So investigators wanted to make sure they had a judge\u2019s sign-off that reviewing communications involving that person wouldn\u2019t violate attorney-client privilege. Judge Howell gave them that sign-off \u2014 because the communications in question were also copied to another person, who was not an attorney. Speculation churned on Twitter about who could have been seeking this pardon. There are a few clues \u2014 the person appears to have a short last name and appears to be in Bureau of Prisons custody. These facts don\u2019t fit most of the \u201cusual suspects\u201d among the president\u2019s criminally entangled associates, so it\u2019s possible that the pardon-seeker is someone who has received little news coverage so far. There\u2019s no indication yet that anyone has been indicted as a result of this investigation. But Judge Howell unsealed the opinion \u2014 issued back in August \u2014 after giving the government three months to take further investigative steps. The identities of the people are redacted because they haven\u2019t yet been charged.  It\u2019s also important to note that no assertion of any knowing wrongdoing on the part of President Trump or White House officials is present in the unredacted parts of the document. (\u201cPardon investigation is Fake News!\u201d Trump tweeted.) But it certainly suggests that unscrupulous people are trying to benefit from Trump\u2019s pardon powers. Attorney General Bill Barr has kept a relatively low profile in recent weeks, but he made news on a number of fronts on Tuesday. First, Barr told Michael Balsamo of the Associated Press that the Justice Department has \u201cnot seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d The statement got a great deal of attention because it flew in the face of Trump\u2019s false claims that the election was stolen from him because of widespread fraud. But it\u2019s notable because, despite Barr\u2019s well-deserved reputation as a staunch political ally of Trump\u2019s, he isn\u2019t willing to go so far as to back Trump\u2019s election fraud claims. Second, and perhaps to soften this blow for Trump, Barr told the Associated Press \u2014 and also Congress \u2014 that he has named US Attorney John Durham as a special counsel. Back in early 2019, Barr tasked Durham, the US attorney for Connecticut, with probing the US government\u2019s handling of the investigation of Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia. Since then, Durham\u2019s investigation has unfolded mostly behind the scenes. (The sole charge has been FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith\u2019s guilty plea over falsifying a document used in a surveillance application \u2014 a matter already uncovered by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general.) It\u2019s unclear whether Durham has found serious misconduct beyond Clinesmith. But Trump and his supporters have long hyped the prospect that Durham will bring charges against top former government officials who investigated the president. Barr reportedly placed heavy pressure on Durham to finish at least some of his work before the 2020 election, but Durham\u2019s top deputy Nora Dannehy resigned in protest in September, and Durham ended up making no further public moves before the election. Barr\u2019s appointment of Durham as special counsel \u2014 made in mid-October, but not announced until Tuesday \u2014 is evidently meant to shield Durham from potentially being fired in the Biden administration (since a special counsel can only be fired for \u201cgood cause\u201d). As for why we\u2019re only learning of this now, Barr suggested he didn\u2019t want to make the announcement before the election to avoid influencing the result.  But for Trump allies, this isn\u2019t enough. Axios\u2019s Jonathan Swan reports that Trump allies saw the special counsel appointment as \u201ca smokescreen to forestall the release of the so-called Durham report,\u201d and that the president has even mused about firing Barr.  Barr visited the White House on Tuesday and stayed there for more than two hours; Swan reports that the attorney general was meeting with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. It is not known what they discussed.",

Cory Johnson, who was convicted of murdering seven people during a drug trafficking operation in Richmond, Virginia, is scheduled for lethal injection on January 14. Like Bourgeois, Johnson\u2019s lawyers argue that there is overwhelming evidence that Johnson has intellectual disabilities.  On January 15, Dustin Higgs is scheduled to be put to death for a crime committed in 1996. The Justice Department claims that Higgs kidnapped and murdered three women, but the Daily Beast reports that while he was present at the scene of the crime, witnesses confirm that Higgs did not kill anyone. Co-defendant Willis Haynes fired the shots, but the Justice Department argues that Higgs coerced his friend Haynes into committing the crime.  But Haynes, who was sentenced to life in prison, confirmed through a signed affidavit that Higgs did not coerce him, saying, \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s theory of our case was bullshit. Dustin didn\u2019t threaten me. I was not scared of him. Dustin didn\u2019t make me do anything that night or ever.\u201d The other person on the Justice Department\u2019s execution schedule is Lisa Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row and the first woman set to be federally executed in nearly 70 years. In 2004, Montgomery killed a pregnant woman and then attempted to pass off the baby as her own. Montgomery, who Dunham said has severe mental illness due to an abusive past, was initially scheduled for execution by lethal injection on December 8, but it was delayed due to her lawyers contracting Covid-19.  Trump is the first president in 17 years to reinstate federal executions, despite a recent poll showing that a record-low number of Americans consider the death penalty \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d Even across party lines, the death penalty has been a historically contentious issue. Since the US Supreme Court revived capital punishment in 1976, state governments have been doing most executions, though those have declined in the past two decades, too.  In addition to pushing through federal executions over the past five months, the Justice Department published a new rule to the Federal Register on Friday that would allow the use of other methods for capital punishment. The new regulation reintroduces the use of firing squads and electrocutions for federal executions in addition to lethal injections. The new rule is set to go into effect in 30 days instead of the generally allotted 60 days. As it stands for the remaining inmates awaiting execution, only Higgs appears not to have a method of execution stated on the Justice Department\u2019s schedule \u2014 the rest are marked for lethal injection. The Trump administration\u2019s move, among many others, is another thing President-elect Biden \u2014 who has signaled at various times that he would end the federal death penalty \u2014 will have to face once in office. Biden, a political veteran, has repeatedly addressed criticism during his presidential campaign over the role he played in passing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, also known as the 1994 crime bill, signed by President Bill Clinton. The bill allowed the expansion of crimes eligible for the federal death penalty, which aided the conviction of some of the inmates now awaiting execution. (Hall was only eligible for the death penalty because the crime bill added kidnapping resulting in death to the list of crimes.) The Trump administration is trying to cut corners and fast-track dozens of rules that range from oil-drilling in the Arctic to immigrant restrictions, as well as the death penalty rule, before Biden takes over. If the rules are finalized, the new administration would have to go through a convoluted process to roll them back. But since Biden has pledged to abolish the death penalty at the federal level and incentivize states to follow the federal government\u2019s example, the new death penalty rule may virtually not be of use in his administration.  \u201cUnlike the environmental regulations or policies making it more difficult to negotiate on trade or world safety, the Biden administration can take as much time as it wants to undo this regulation,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cUndoing it isn\u2019t that difficult. I believe the regulation is intended to make it easier for the Trump administration to carry out the remaining lame-duck executions.\u201d The bigger question is how Biden\u2019s administration will transform a historically racist criminal justice system while also healing the wounds brought by the Trump administration.  \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s conduct, when it comes to criminal legal issues, has been highly political, and mostly out of step with the direction that most of the United States is heading,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cWhen push came to shove, it reverted to policies that are more extreme in their cruelty and the arbitrariness of their application than anything else we have seen in modern American history.\u201d  The Trump administration\u2019s push for federal executions, while the country has been preoccupied with the election and the pandemic, is no different.

    "article_text": "The past 24 hours in Trump\u2019s legal issues and pardon news, explained President Donald Trump, over the last 24 hours, has made one thing abundantly clear: His final few weeks in office will not be lacking in the legal drama and corruption concerns that have pervaded his presidency. After having already pardoned his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Trump has been discussing potential broad preemptive pardons for his children Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka; his son-in-law Jared Kushner; and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, per reporting from ABC News and the New York Times. None of these people has been charged with any crime, so these pardons would have to entail sweeping assertions of impunity. Meanwhile, a newly released, heavily redacted court opinion revealed that federal investigators have been probing an alleged corrupt scheme to provide political contributions (apparently to the Trump campaign or Republican groups, but we don\u2019t know the specifics) in exchange for a presidential pardon from Trump. The identities of the people involved in this matter are redacted, but the news makes clear that even before Trump lost, matters involving his pardon power have been under investigative scrutiny. Also on Tuesday, Attorney General Bill Barr returned to the headlines after a quiet period. Barr told the Associated Press that the Justice Department has \u201cnot seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d Perhaps to soften the blow to President Donald Trump\u2019s hopes from this admission, Barr also revealed that he has appointed John Durham \u2014 the US attorney investigating the conduct of the FBI\u2019s Trump campaign/Russia probe \u2014 as a special counsel, to make it more difficult for Biden to fire him. (Barr spent more than two hours at the White House Tuesday afternoon.) All in all, Trump is continuing to try to bend law enforcement agencies to his will \u2014 but having limited success of late. So he\u2019s being increasingly drawn to the pardon power, which he can exercise on his own authority, to save his close associates and family members from possible legal consequences. Around midday Tuesday, I wrote about how \u201cTrump\u2019s pardon shenanigans are ramping up,\u201d because his recent pardon for Flynn contained preemptive aspects, and because he was reportedly discussing a similarly preemptive pardon for his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. But the news of the day wasn\u2019t done. The New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman and Michael Schmidt later reported that Trump has also talked with advisers about potentially granting preemptive pardons to his three eldest children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump \u2014 as well as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The business dealings of both the Trump Organization and the Kushner family have come under investigative scrutiny, and Donald Jr.\u2019s meeting with a Russian lawyer to try and get dirt on Hillary Clinton was also scrutinized as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe.  But none of these have resulted in any criminal charges against Trump\u2019s children or Kushner. So any hypothetical pardon would have to be quite broadly written and preemptive. (It also could not cover state crimes, which could be a problem, as the major Trump Organization investigation is being pursued by New York state prosecutors.) It would also, of course, be a stunning and unprecedented use of executive power for a president to grant broad immunity from federal criminal prosecution to his children. Some Trump allies, like Fox News host Sean Hannity, are arguing that the move would be justified because they expect prosecutors under Biden to pursue a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d of people close to Trump.  Yet if Trump \u2014 or his children \u2014 have political ambitions in 2024, that might present an incentive to hold back on the broadest possible uses of the pardon power.  Just as Trump has been turning more attention to how far he wants to go in using his pardon power, news broke that federal investigators are already looking into what they view as a corrupt effort to get such a pardon from Trump. The revelation came from a newly unsealed court opinion by Beryl Howell, the chief judge of the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The opinion is heavily redacted, though, so we are missing key details, including the identities of the people involved in this purported scheme. But there\u2019s a fair amount we can piece together from the unredacted bits. The gist is that investigators say there are two separate schemes aimed at getting a certain person a pardon or sentence reduction.  Investigators uncovered these two purported schemes while reviewing material seized in the course of a preexisting investigation. But there was one issue: One of the people involved in lobbying the White House was a lawyer. So investigators wanted to make sure they had a judge\u2019s sign-off that reviewing communications involving that person wouldn\u2019t violate attorney-client privilege. Judge Howell gave them that sign-off \u2014 because the communications in question were also copied to another person, who was not an attorney. Speculation churned on Twitter about who could have been seeking this pardon. There are a few clues \u2014 the person appears to have a short last name and appears to be in Bureau of Prisons custody. These facts don\u2019t fit most of the \u201cusual suspects\u201d among the president\u2019s criminally entangled associates, so it\u2019s possible that the pardon-seeker is someone who has received little news coverage so far. There\u2019s no indication yet that anyone has been indicted as a result of this investigation. But Judge Howell unsealed the opinion \u2014 issued back in August \u2014 after giving the government three months to take further investigative steps. The identities of the people are redacted because they haven\u2019t yet been charged.  It\u2019s also important to note that no assertion of any knowing wrongdoing on the part of President Trump or White House officials is present in the unredacted parts of the document. (\u201cPardon investigation is Fake News!\u201d Trump tweeted.) But it certainly suggests that unscrupulous people are trying to benefit from Trump\u2019s pardon powers. Attorney General Bill Barr has kept a relatively low profile in recent weeks, but he made news on a number of fronts on Tuesday. First, Barr told Michael Balsamo of the Associated Press that the Justice Department has \u201cnot seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d The statement got a great deal of attention because it flew in the face of Trump\u2019s false claims that the election was stolen from him because of widespread fraud. But it\u2019s notable because, despite Barr\u2019s well-deserved reputation as a staunch political ally of Trump\u2019s, he isn\u2019t willing to go so far as to back Trump\u2019s election fraud claims. Second, and perhaps to soften this blow for Trump, Barr told the Associated Press \u2014 and also Congress \u2014 that he has named US Attorney John Durham as a special counsel. Back in early 2019, Barr tasked Durham, the US attorney for Connecticut, with probing the US government\u2019s handling of the investigation of Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia. Since then, Durham\u2019s investigation has unfolded mostly behind the scenes. (The sole charge has been FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith\u2019s guilty plea over falsifying a document used in a surveillance application \u2014 a matter already uncovered by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general.) It\u2019s unclear whether Durham has found serious misconduct beyond Clinesmith. But Trump and his supporters have long hyped the prospect that Durham will bring charges against top former government officials who investigated the president. Barr reportedly placed heavy pressure on Durham to finish at least some of his work before the 2020 election, but Durham\u2019s top deputy Nora Dannehy resigned in protest in September, and Durham ended up making no further public moves before the election. Barr\u2019s appointment of Durham as special counsel \u2014 made in mid-October, but not announced until Tuesday \u2014 is evidently meant to shield Durham from potentially being fired in the Biden administration (since a special counsel can only be fired for \u201cgood cause\u201d). As for why we\u2019re only learning of this now, Barr suggested he didn\u2019t want to make the announcement before the election to avoid influencing the result.  But for Trump allies, this isn\u2019t enough. Axios\u2019s Jonathan Swan reports that Trump allies saw the special counsel appointment as \u201ca smokescreen to forestall the release of the so-called Durham report,\u201d and that the president has even mused about firing Barr.  Barr visited the White House on Tuesday and stayed there for more than two hours; Swan reports that the attorney general was meeting with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. It is not known what they discussed.",

    "article_text": "The rise in murders in the US, explained As if the Covid-19 pandemic wasn\u2019t bad enough, America is also seeing a surge in homicides this year. A new report, by the Council on Criminal Justice, found homicides have increased sharply this year across 21 US cities with relevant data: \u201cHomicide rates increased by 42% during the summer and 34% in the fall over the summer and fall of 2019.\u201d Other data, from crime analyst Jeff Asher, found murder is up 36 percent throughout the year so far, compared to the same period in 2019, in a sample of 51 US cities. A preliminary FBI report also found murders up 15 percent nationwide in the first half of 2020. The increase in homicides is large and widespread enough to raise serious alarms for criminologists and other experts. So what\u2019s going on? Some experts have cited the protests this summer over the police killings of George Floyd and others \u2014 which could\u2019ve had a range of effects, from officers pulling back from their duties to greater community distrust in police, leading to more unchecked violence. Others point to the bad economy. Another potential factor is a huge increase in gun purchases this year. Still others posit boredom and social displacement as a result of physical distancing leading people to cause more trouble. Above all, though, experts caution it\u2019s simply been a very unusual year with the Covid-19 pandemic. That makes it difficult to say what, exactly, is happening with crime rates. \u201cThe current year, 2020, is an extreme deviation from baseline \u2014 extreme,\u201d Tracey Meares, founding director at the Justice Collaboratory at Yale Law School, previously told me. That offers a bit of good news: It\u2019s possible that the end of the pandemic will come and homicide rates will fall again, as they generally have for the past few decades in the US. But no one knows for sure if that will happen, or if we\u2019re now seeing a shift in long-term trends. Uncertainty about what\u2019s going on isn\u2019t exactly new in the field of criminal justice. Rates of crime and violence have plummeted over the past few decades in the US, yet there is no agreed-upon explanation for why. There are theories applying the best evidence, research, and data available, ranging from changes in policing to a drop in lead exposure to the rise of video games. But there\u2019s no consensus. That a decades-long phenomenon is still so hard to explain shows the need for humility before jumping to conclusions about the current trends. \u201cWe don\u2019t know nearly enough to know what\u2019s going on at the given moment,\u201d Jennifer Doleac, director of the Justice Tech Lab, previously told me. \u201cThe current moment is so unusual for so many different reasons that \u2026 it\u2019s really hard to speculate about broad phenomena that are driving these trends when we\u2019re not even sure if there\u2019s a trend yet.\u201d All of that said, here\u2019s what we do know. There are several good sources, from criminologists, economists, and other data analysts, for what\u2019s happened with crime and violence so far this year: an analysis by Jeff Asher; a Council on Criminal Justice report written by Richard Rosenfeld and Ernesto Lopez; City Crime Stats, a website from the University of Pennsylvania set up by David Abrams, Priyanka Goonetilleke, Elizabeth Holmdahl, and Kathy Qian; and a preliminary report from the FBI. Crime analyst Jeff Asher offers the most recent data, looking at crime trends in 51 US cities in 2020 so far compared to 2019. He found murders are up 36 percent. Despite previous comments by President Donald Trump blaming the increase on Democrat-run cities, Asher found murders are up about 36 percent in both cities with Democratic mayors and those with Republican mayors. In a smaller sample of US cities, he found violent crime overall is flat and property crimes are down. The Council on Criminal Justice report, updated in November, analyzed crime in 28 US cities, ranging in size from Los Angeles to St. Petersburg, Florida, through October. The authors looked for \u201cstructural breaks,\u201d in which reported crime increased or decreased more than would be expected, based on data from previous years. They found structural breaks in homicide, aggravated assault, and gun assault increases, particularly starting in the summer. There weren\u2019t significant increases in domestic assault (although the data for domestic violence is fairly limited), and robbery was actually down. Other kinds of crime, including larceny and drug offenses, largely decreased. Here\u2019s the graph for homicide increases: \u201cThere were 610 more homicides in the 21 cities in the summer and fall of 2020 than during the same period in 2019,\u201d the report found. City Crime Stats\u2019 data complicates matters a bit, comparing the 2020 crime trends in 28 major cities to a five-year baseline. With this approach, the homicide increases don\u2019t seem quite as dramatic in many cities, and other types of crime appear to be mostly down as well. Still, homicides do seem to be significantly up in many of the cities included in the City Crime Stats data set.  Here, for example, is Chicago\u2019s homicide trend, which shows this year\u2019s rate (the red line) rising above the five-year baseline (the gray line and shading) at several points throughout the year: There\u2019s a lot of variation from city to city. Minneapolis, Milwaukee, New York City, and Philadelphia are on the high end of homicides or seeing a flat-out increase. Baltimore, Boston, and Columbus are close to historical trends or actually down. Overall, though, Abrams said that his data suggests there was a significant increase in homicides from May to June: \u201cWe did find a statistically significant increase in homicides \u2014 about 21 percent \u2014 in aggregate in the cities we looked at in the month after versus before those protests,\u201d he previously told me, cautioning we can\u2019t say with any confidence if the protests were the cause. \u201cSame for shootings, but that\u2019s from a smaller number of cities.\u201d A preliminary FBI report confirmed these other reports\u2019 findings for the first half of 2020. It found a 15 percent increase in murders, a 5 percent increase in aggravated assaults, and an 8 percent decrease in property crime nationwide from January through June, compared to the same time period in 2019. The FBI will likely release a report for all of 2020 later in 2021. In Chicago, as well as some other cities, the apparent increase in homicides began before the protests over the police killing of George Floyd. And in some cases, as in Chicago, the spike abruptly ended almost as quickly as it started, only to surge again weeks later, after the protests had calmed. So it\u2019s hard to blame only the protests for a spike \u2014 especially because we know that other factors likely played a role, such as the start of summer, when crime tends to go up, and the end of stay-at-home orders. City-by-city variation isn\u2019t unique to 2020. It\u2019s expected, even when talking about national crime waves or declines, to see some places go up and others go down for different kinds of crime. The US is a big country, and a range of local factors can affect different kinds of crime. Still, there\u2019s enough in the four data sets to draw some conclusions: Homicides are up significantly this year. But other kinds of crime, including violent crime overall, aren\u2019t up and may actually have decreased so far this year. There was also a brief spike in burglaries in major cities starting in late May \u2014 an increase that was so brief and contained to specific cities that experts told me it was almost certainly due to the riots and looting surrounding some Black Lives Matter protests. As Asher noted on Twitter, a disconnect between murders and other crimes would be odd: \u201cViolent crime and murder almost always move in the same direction and they are never this far apart nationally.\u201d One way to reconcile this may be the nature of crime reporting. All of this data is based on reports to governments, typically local police departments. But with people stuck at home, and no government agency operating normally this year, perhaps these reports are just less likely to happen or get picked up, especially lower-level crimes involving drugs or stolen property. At the same time, it\u2019s far harder for a homicide to go completely unreported \u2014 it\u2019s difficult to ignore a dead person. This is why, for much of US history, the homicide rate has been used as a proxy for violent crime overall: The nature of homicide made it a more reliable metric than others for crime. In other words, it\u2019s possible that other kinds of crime are up this year, but they\u2019re simply going unreported. At any rate, homicides are up significantly. One note on domestic violence: Some activists and experts worried it would increase this year as people were forced to stay home more often. The Council on Criminal Justice report and City Crime Stats\u2019 analysis suggest that\u2019s not the case, showing no significant change or a drop in some places. But there\u2019s reason for skepticism: Both sources are pulling data from a limited number of cities. And reporting limitations may especially apply to domestic violence, since this year victims are potentially more likely to be trapped with their abusers and unable to make a phone call for help. There are plenty of caveats to all this data. Much of it only represents trends in large US cities, which means it might not be representative of the country as a whole. And it only covers 2020 through November at the latest. But the trends, particularly with homicides, are very alarming. So why are homicides up? When I posed this question to experts, they again cautioned that no one can say with certainty what\u2019s going on. That said, they offered some possible explanations, based on the limited information we have so far: 1) The pandemic has really messed things up: Looming over absolutely every discussion about 2020 is the Covid-19 pandemic. That\u2019s no different for discussions about crime and violence. This year is very unusual, with many forced to stay at home and living in fear of a new, deadly virus. That could lead to all sorts of unpredictable behaviors that experts don\u2019t understand yet and might take years to explain. 2) Depolicing led to more violence: In response to the 2014 and 2015 waves of Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality, officers in some cities pulled back, either out of fear that any act of aggressive policing could get them in trouble or in a counterprotest against Black Lives Matter. While protesters have challenged the crime-fighting effectiveness of police, there is a sizable body of evidence that more, and certain kinds of, policing do lead to less crime. Given that, some experts said that depolicing in response to protests could have led to more violence \u2014 what some in years past called the \u201cFerguson effect,\u201d after the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police shooting of Michael Brown, and also seen in Baltimore after the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray. 3) Lack of trust in police led to more violence: In response to the \u201cFerguson effect\u201d in 2015, some experts offered a different view of what was happening: Maybe people had lost trust in the police and, as a result, they relied more on street justice and other illegal activities to resolve interpersonal disputes \u2014 an interpretation of \u201clegal cynicism,\u201d explained well in Jill Leovy\u2019s Ghettoside and supported by some empirical research. Perhaps Floyd\u2019s killing and the ensuing protests led to a similar phenomenon this year. 4) More guns led to more gun violence: There\u2019s been a big surge in gun buying this year, seemingly in response to concerns about personal safety during a pandemic. And as the research has shown time and time again, more guns mean more gun violence. A recent, preliminary study from researchers at UC Davis already concluded that gun purchases led to more gun violence than there would be otherwise through May this year. That could have further exacerbated homicide increases. 5) Overwhelmed hospitals led to more deaths: One way to explain a flat or dropping violent crime rate as homicides rise is that the violent crime was deadlier than usual. With health care systems across the US at times close to capacity or at capacity due to Covid-19, maybe hospitals and their staff couldn\u2019t treat violent crime victims as well \u2014 increasing the chances they died this year. That could translate to more deaths, and homicides, even if violent crime remained flat or declined. 6) Idle hands led to more violence: Throughout the pandemic, a lot of people have been bored \u2014 with forms of entertainment, from restaurants to movie theaters, closed down. Schools are limited or closed too, and millions have been newly unemployed. Other support programs that can prevent violence were shuttered due to the closures. All of that could have led to conflict, and possibly more crime and violence. But, experts cautioned, this is speculative, with little evidence so far to support it. 7) A bad economy led to more violence: With the economy tanking this year, some people may have been pushed to desperate acts to make ends meet. Disruptions in the drug market, as product and customers dried up in a bad economy, may have led to more violent competition over what\u2019s left. The bad economy also left local and state governments with less funding for social supports that can keep people out of trouble. All of that, and more, could have contributed to more crime and violence \u2014 but this, too, is still very speculative. Another possibility: None of these explanations is right. With limited data in strange times, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it turns out we have no idea what\u2019s going on right now. \u201cWe can bet on it being unpredictable,\u201d Doleac said. Again, there\u2019s still no consensus about what\u2019s caused crime to decline since the 1990s. In that context, it\u2019s no surprise there\u2019s nowhere near a consensus as to why a homicide spike has occurred so far this year. It\u2019s possible that before we understand why it\u2019s happening, the year\u2019s alarming homicide trends could recede. It\u2019s happened before: In 2005 and 2006, the homicide rate briefly increased, only to start declining again before hitting record lows in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the rates also spiked again only to start to dip after. In both instances, these years were effectively blips and the overall crime decline America has seen for the past three decades continued. Maybe after this very weird year ends, crime and violence trends will, similarly, go back to the previous normal. But that\u2019s not a guarantee \u2014 and it\u2019s not something we should rely on, experts said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand why crime and violence went down,\u201d John Roman, a criminal justice expert at NORC at the University of Chicago, previously told me. \u201cBeing able to say we should expect this unexplained phenomenon to continue strikes me as sort of irrational.\u201d Even if we can\u2019t explain what may be causing a homicide spike, there are certain strategies that might help fight crime in the short term \u2014 such as deploying police in crime hot spots (though that would have to be done carefully and with reforms, given the current political climate around policing), a \u201cfocused deterrence\u201d program that targets the few people in a community engaging in violence with a mix of support and sanctions, and using civilian \u201cinterrupters\u201d to personally intervene in cases in which violence seems likely to break out. Notably, a lot of this work is done at the local and state level, where the vast majority of police departments are based. The federal government can incentivize certain practices, like President-elect Joe Biden has proposed doing, but it ultimately falls on cities, counties, and states to carry out new or revised approaches. Many of the evidence-based approaches rely on in-person contact, which requires ending the pandemic. \u201cThe police, public health, and community approaches to violence reduction require that people meet face-to-face; they cannot be replaced by Zoom,\u201d Rosenfeld and Lopez wrote in one of their reports. \u201cAn underappreciated consequence of the pandemic is how social-distancing requirements have affected outreach to high-risk individuals.\u201d So the first priority should be to end the pandemic \u2014 ending its potential ripple effects on crime and enabling evidence-based approaches that can help reduce crime. But to do that, the US public and governments will need to truly embrace strategies that have worked for countries like South Korea and Germany against Covid-19: physical distancing, masking, and testing, tracing, and isolating the sick. In this sense, Trump\u2019s failures to address Covid-19 may be leading to more violence. \u201cSeeing what\u2019s happening with these [crime] numbers can point us to or at least get us thinking about what potential policy levers we could employ that would be helpful,\u201d Doleac said. \u201cOtherwise, our attention is probably better focused on making sure we\u2019re all wearing masks.\u201d Beyond the pandemic, police are going to have more trouble fighting crime \u2014 including any current or future spikes \u2014 if large segments of the community don\u2019t trust them. That\u2019s where police reform comes into play. It\u2019s a complicated topic, separate from a possible spike in violence this year. But, in short, experts say police should, at a minimum, show the communities they serve that they understand the concerns, acknowledge mistakes, and will change how officers are trained and deployed. Otherwise, there\u2019s a good chance that protests against police will flare up, just as they did from 2014 to 2016 and have again this year. If protests lead to more violence \u2014 whether by leading to depolicing, or sowing and exposing distrust in law enforcement \u2014 that\u2019s going to create public safety problems. To put it another way: There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about crime, why it happens, and how to stop it. But it\u2019s going to be much easier to wrap our heads around these issues once things get closer to how they should be \u2014 and that means seriously addressing the pandemic and protests against police brutality. Unfortunately, the US is going in the opposite direction, with a surge of Covid-19 this fall and winter and Trump exacerbating police-community tensions with his rhetoric and push to deploy unsolicited federal agents in some US cities. \u201cHow optimistic should we be for the rest of the summer?\u201d Roman said. \u201cI think the answer is not terribly optimistic, because none of these factors seem to be abating with the return of Covid.\u201d  ",

    "article_text": "How Trump\u2019s blizzard of misleading fundraising emails explains his refusal to concede President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing effort to overturn the election results is almost certain to fail, because Joe Biden clearly and decisively won the election. But the president has self-interested reasons for dragging out the fight as long as he can. The nearly 500 emails blasted out by the Trump campaign in November raised at least $170 million after Election Day, as Will Steakin and Soo Rin Kim reported for ABC on Tuesday. (For context, the Trump campaign account\u2019s best monthly fundraising haul before the election came in September, when they raised a mere $81 million.) They\u2019ve done so with highly misleading insinuations that the money is funding Trump\u2019s farcical legal challenges of the election results, when a careful reading of the emails\u2019 fine print shows the money is largely being raised for things like paying down campaign debt and funding Trump\u2019s post-presidency operation.  And it won\u2019t be especially hard for Trump to eventually route some of his new leadership PAC\u2019s windfall into his own pockets. (A \u201cleadership PAC\u201d is a type of political committee formed by current or former elected officials.) \u201cWhile he can\u2019t just cut himself a massive check, he could rent out Mar-a-Lago for an obscene amount of money \u2014 leadership PAC money \u2014 to give a speech himself, and that would be totally legal,\u201d Jordan Libowitz, communications director for Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington (CREW), told Vox in an interview. \u201cSo if you view the Trump administration as one long grift to redirect money from taxpayers and political supporters into Trump properties, this would be a good move to do that.\u201d But the fact that Trump could reroute contributions solicited by his campaign to his own pockets would likely come as news to some of the Trump followers who have ponied up during a time when losing campaigns are usually winding down operations. That\u2019s because the emails the campaign continues to bombard people with nearly a month after Trump\u2019s loss to Biden are misleading at best. On November 15, for instance, the Trump campaign sent out an email that framed its post-election fundraising pitch around the president\u2019s failing legal fight to overturn the results. \u201cPresident Trump is FIGHTING BACK to defend the integrity of this Election, but he can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d the email said. \u201cHe needs YOU to step up and join him by contributing to our critical Election Defense Fund. This is so important that he\u2019s giving YOU the opportunity to increase your impact by 1000%.\u201d There\u2019s just one problem: There is no such thing as Trump\u2019s \u201cElection Defense Fund.\u201d Instead, as Josh Dawsey and Michelle Ye Hee Lee detailed for the Washington Post, the majority of the money raised by email pitches of that sort goes to the leadership PAC Libowitz mentioned: According to @TrumpEmail, a Twitter account that has closely monitored Trump\u2019s fundraising emails for three years, the tone of the missives has subtly shifted in recent days from hyping the fake \u201cElection Defense Fund\u201d to saying things like, \u201cOne thing has become clear these last few days, I am the American People\u2019s ALL-TIME favorite President.\u201d The email that contained that claim also cited already-debunked claims from disreputable outlets like the Epoch Times to insinuate that the 2020 election is still up for grabs.  But the one constant is the emails aim at getting supporters to open their wallets \u2014 which they have. Campaign officials told the Post the bulk of the fundraising has come from small-dollar donors; the emails have activated \u201cthe president\u2019s base of loyal and fervent financial supporters, who tend to contribute the most when they feel the president is under siege or facing unfair political attacks.\u201d  Unlike PACs that are tied to chambers of Congress, there are very few restrictions on what Trump can do with the leadership PAC money. In addition to the possibility of Trump using the funds to hold events at his properties (and thereby reroute it to his own pockets), Libowitz explained that he could use them to continue to hold political rallies around the country. \u201cRenting out a basketball arena does not come cheaply, and given his history of not paying places back and the fact that he\u2019s not a candidate, or at least not a current nominee, it\u2019s much more likely people will require cash up front\u201d after he leaves office, Libowitz said. \u201cSo he could rent out Trump Force One to the leadership PAC and charge his leadership PAC for his own use or his own plane to go to a rally. It basically just opens up a bunch of new ways he can continue to bring in money from his supporters that he can then redirect to his businesses and then, of course, to himself and his family.\u201d So while it would be in the best interests of the country for Trump to acknowledge that he lost and psychologically prepare his followers for the reality that Biden will be inaugurated as president next month, dragging it out for as long possible allows him to keep grifting. \u201cI think there is a question of whether this is just one last gasp of trying to milk every dollar he can out of his supporters, or whether people have so convinced themselves that he\u2019s going to find some secret way to become president that they\u2019ll continue to give him money,\u201d Libowitz said.",

    "article_text": "The past 24 hours in Trump\u2019s legal issues and pardon news, explained President Donald Trump, over the last 24 hours, has made one thing abundantly clear: His final few weeks in office will not be lacking in the legal drama and corruption concerns that have pervaded his presidency. After having already pardoned his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Trump has been discussing potential broad preemptive pardons for his children Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka; his son-in-law Jared Kushner; and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, per reporting from ABC News and the New York Times. None of these people has been charged with any crime, so these pardons would have to entail sweeping assertions of impunity. Meanwhile, a newly released, heavily redacted court opinion revealed that federal investigators have been probing an alleged corrupt scheme to provide political contributions (apparently to the Trump campaign or Republican groups, but we don\u2019t know the specifics) in exchange for a presidential pardon from Trump. The identities of the people involved in this matter are redacted, but the news makes clear that even before Trump lost, matters involving his pardon power have been under investigative scrutiny. Also on Tuesday, Attorney General Bill Barr returned to the headlines after a quiet period. Barr told the Associated Press that the Justice Department has \u201cnot seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d Perhaps to soften the blow to President Donald Trump\u2019s hopes from this admission, Barr also revealed that he has appointed John Durham \u2014 the US attorney investigating the conduct of the FBI\u2019s Trump campaign/Russia probe \u2014 as a special counsel, to make it more difficult for Biden to fire him. (Barr spent more than two hours at the White House Tuesday afternoon.) All in all, Trump is continuing to try to bend law enforcement agencies to his will \u2014 but having limited success of late. So he\u2019s being increasingly drawn to the pardon power, which he can exercise on his own authority, to save his close associates and family members from possible legal consequences. Around midday Tuesday, I wrote about how \u201cTrump\u2019s pardon shenanigans are ramping up,\u201d because his recent pardon for Flynn contained preemptive aspects, and because he was reportedly discussing a similarly preemptive pardon for his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. But the news of the day wasn\u2019t done. The New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman and Michael Schmidt later reported that Trump has also talked with advisers about potentially granting preemptive pardons to his three eldest children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump \u2014 as well as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The business dealings of both the Trump Organization and the Kushner family have come under investigative scrutiny, and Donald Jr.\u2019s meeting with a Russian lawyer to try and get dirt on Hillary Clinton was also scrutinized as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe.  But none of these have resulted in any criminal charges against Trump\u2019s children or Kushner. So any hypothetical pardon would have to be quite broadly written and preemptive. (It also could not cover state crimes, which could be a problem, as the major Trump Organization investigation is being pursued by New York state prosecutors.) It would also, of course, be a stunning and unprecedented use of executive power for a president to grant broad immunity from federal criminal prosecution to his children. Some Trump allies, like Fox News host Sean Hannity, are arguing that the move would be justified because they expect prosecutors under Biden to pursue a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d of people close to Trump.  Yet if Trump \u2014 or his children \u2014 have political ambitions in 2024, that might present an incentive to hold back on the broadest possible uses of the pardon power.  Just as Trump has been turning more attention to how far he wants to go in using his pardon power, news broke that federal investigators are already looking into what they view as a corrupt effort to get such a pardon from Trump. The revelation came from a newly unsealed court opinion by Beryl Howell, the chief judge of the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The opinion is heavily redacted, though, so we are missing key details, including the identities of the people involved in this purported scheme. But there\u2019s a fair amount we can piece together from the unredacted bits. The gist is that investigators say there are two separate schemes aimed at getting a certain person a pardon or sentence reduction.  Investigators uncovered these two purported schemes while reviewing material seized in the course of a preexisting investigation. But there was one issue: One of the people involved in lobbying the White House was a lawyer. So investigators wanted to make sure they had a judge\u2019s sign-off that reviewing communications involving that person wouldn\u2019t violate attorney-client privilege. Judge Howell gave them that sign-off \u2014 because the communications in question were also copied to another person, who was not an attorney. Speculation churned on Twitter about who could have been seeking this pardon. There are a few clues \u2014 the person appears to have a short last name and appears to be in Bureau of Prisons custody. These facts don\u2019t fit most of the \u201cusual suspects\u201d among the president\u2019s criminally entangled associates, so it\u2019s possible that the pardon-seeker is someone who has received little news coverage so far. There\u2019s no indication yet that anyone has been indicted as a result of this investigation. But Judge Howell unsealed the opinion \u2014 issued back in August \u2014 after giving the government three months to take further investigative steps. The identities of the people are redacted because they haven\u2019t yet been charged.  It\u2019s also important to note that no assertion of any knowing wrongdoing on the part of President Trump or White House officials is present in the unredacted parts of the document. (\u201cPardon investigation is Fake News!\u201d Trump tweeted.) But it certainly suggests that unscrupulous people are trying to benefit from Trump\u2019s pardon powers. Attorney General Bill Barr has kept a relatively low profile in recent weeks, but he made news on a number of fronts on Tuesday. First, Barr told Michael Balsamo of the Associated Press that the Justice Department has \u201cnot seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d The statement got a great deal of attention because it flew in the face of Trump\u2019s false claims that the election was stolen from him because of widespread fraud. But it\u2019s notable because, despite Barr\u2019s well-deserved reputation as a staunch political ally of Trump\u2019s, he isn\u2019t willing to go so far as to back Trump\u2019s election fraud claims. Second, and perhaps to soften this blow for Trump, Barr told the Associated Press \u2014 and also Congress \u2014 that he has named US Attorney John Durham as a special counsel. Back in early 2019, Barr tasked Durham, the US attorney for Connecticut, with probing the US government\u2019s handling of the investigation of Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia. Since then, Durham\u2019s investigation has unfolded mostly behind the scenes. (The sole charge has been FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith\u2019s guilty plea over falsifying a document used in a surveillance application \u2014 a matter already uncovered by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general.) It\u2019s unclear whether Durham has found serious misconduct beyond Clinesmith. But Trump and his supporters have long hyped the prospect that Durham will bring charges against top former government officials who investigated the president. Barr reportedly placed heavy pressure on Durham to finish at least some of his work before the 2020 election, but Durham\u2019s top deputy Nora Dannehy resigned in protest in September, and Durham ended up making no further public moves before the election. Barr\u2019s appointment of Durham as special counsel \u2014 made in mid-October, but not announced until Tuesday \u2014 is evidently meant to shield Durham from potentially being fired in the Biden administration (since a special counsel can only be fired for \u201cgood cause\u201d). As for why we\u2019re only learning of this now, Barr suggested he didn\u2019t want to make the announcement before the election to avoid influencing the result.  But for Trump allies, this isn\u2019t enough. Axios\u2019s Jonathan Swan reports that Trump allies saw the special counsel appointment as \u201ca smokescreen to forestall the release of the so-called Durham report,\u201d and that the president has even mused about firing Barr.  Barr visited the White House on Tuesday and stayed there for more than two hours; Swan reports that the attorney general was meeting with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. It is not known what they discussed.",

    "h1": "The high rate of executions during Trump\u2019s last weeks in office, explained ",
    "first_p": "",
    "article_text": "The high rate of executions during Trump\u2019s last weeks in office, explained   When five Black and Latino teenagers were wrongfully convicted of the rape of a jogger in New York City\u2019s Central Park in 1989, prominent businessman Donald Trump bought newspaper advertisements calling on New York state to \u201cbring back the death penalty\u201d in the wake of the attack. Little did the country know, Trump\u2019s views on capital punishment then would inform his presidency decades later: In July, the Trump administration reinstated the death penalty at the federal level after a 17-year hiatus. The return of federal executions demonstrates an unprecedented and grim picture of Trump\u2019s legacy in contrast to previous administrations. The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board described it as a \u201csickening spree of executions.\u201d To put it in perspective, only three people had been executed by the federal government in the past 50 years. Meanwhile, in less than five months, eight people have already been put to death by Trump\u2019s Justice Department, with five more executions scheduled to happen before Trump leaves office.  \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s policy regarding a death penalty is just historically abhorrent,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of Death Penalty Information Center, a bipartisan organization that does not take a position for or against the death penalty, but rather is critical of the way capital punishment is administered.  If the remaining executions in December are carried out \u2014 making a total of 10 for 2020 \u2014 it will mark more civilian executions in a single calendar year than any other presidency in the 20th and 21st centuries. \u201cNo one has conducted this number of federal civilian executions in this short period of time in American history,\u201d Dunham added. Of the five upcoming federal executions during the lame-duck period, four of them are Black men, while the fifth will be the first woman to be executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. These federal executions come in concert with the rallying cry for racial justice and an overhaul of America\u2019s policing and criminal justice systems that has left a disproportionate number of Black people arrested, jailed, convicted, and dead. More than 44 percent of the remaining 54 people on federal death row are Black, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, even though Black people make up only 13 percent of the US population.  \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re having a record-high number of federal executions, at the same time that we\u2019re near a record low in state executions, in the middle of a pandemic, shows how much the Trump administration is either out of touch or that it cannot resist gratuitous acts of cruelty,\u201d Dunham said, adding that only seven state executions will occur this year \u2014 the lowest since states began carrying out executions in colonial times. \u201cNobody needs to carry out an execution during a pandemic.\u201d Just last week, the Justice Department also published a rule that would allow other methods for capital punishment, such as firing squads, lethal gas, and electrocutions; Attorney General Bill Barr is currently racing to finalize that rule. Trump\u2019s push for additional methods and a number of federal executions will be part of his presidential legacy and highlights a stark divide between the administration\u2019s actions and dwindling support for the death penalty among Americans. On November 19, Orlando Hall, a Black man sentenced to death for kidnapping, rape, and murder in 1994, became the eighth and latest inmate to be executed by the federal government since it reinstated federal executions this summer. He is also the first in more than a century to be put to death during a lame-duck period. Shortly before Hall was executed by lethal injection, the US Supreme Court had denied his request to stop the execution \u2014 with new Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the majority ruling.  While Hall is the second Black man to be executed out of the eight so far since July, the remaining men scheduled to be put to death are all Black. \u201cIn an apparent effort to forestall criticism that the federal executions were racist, the administration selected white prisoners first,\u201d Dunham said; the executions were reinstated as racial justice protests broke out across the country this summer. \u201cWhat\u2019s striking about that, though, is that it still tells us a lot about whose lives matter because only one of the people executed so far was convicted for killing an African American.\u201d Brandon Bernard, convicted of kidnapping and murder, is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on December 10. Bernard, who is also Black, was only 18 years old when he committed crimes that resulted in the deaths of a young white married couple in 1999. But five of the nine surviving jurors who supported the death penalty at the time now believe it is inappropriate. Even Angela Moore, the federal prosecutor who helped put Bernard on death row, wrote an op-ed in the Indianapolis Star making a case for why the federal government should let him live. \u201cI always took pride in representing the United States as a federal prosecutor, and I think executing Brandon would be a terrible stain on the nation\u2019s honor,\u201d Moore wrote.  During his time in prison, Bernard has been a model prisoner, mentoring at-risk youth. \u201cHaving learned so much since 2000 about the maturation of the human brain and having seen Brandon grow into a humble, remorseful adult fully capable of living peacefully in prison, how can we say he is among that tiny group of offenders who must be put to death?\u201d Moore wrote.  Alfred Bourgeois, a Black truck driver in Texas who was convicted of abusing and killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2002, is scheduled for execution the day after Bernard. Bourgeois\u2019s execution was originally scheduled for January 2020 but was halted by a federal judge who blocked the Trump administration\u2019s early moves to bring back the federal death penalty. Bourgeois\u2019s lawyers then argued to suspend his death sentence on the grounds that he\u2019s entitled to an intellectual disability evaluation under the Eighth Amendment.  The next two inmates on death row are scheduled for execution in 2021 just a few days before Biden\u2019s inauguration. Cory Johnson, who was convicted of murdering seven people during a drug trafficking operation in Richmond, Virginia, is scheduled for lethal injection on January 14. Like Bourgeois, Johnson\u2019s lawyers argue that there is overwhelming evidence that Johnson has intellectual disabilities.  On January 15, Dustin Higgs is scheduled to be put to death for a crime committed in 1996. The Justice Department claims that Higgs kidnapped and murdered three women, but the Daily Beast reports that while he was present at the scene of the crime, witnesses confirm that Higgs did not kill anyone. Co-defendant Willis Haynes fired the shots, but the Justice Department argues that Higgs coerced his friend Haynes into committing the crime.  But Haynes, who was sentenced to life in prison, confirmed through a signed affidavit that Higgs did not coerce him, saying, \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s theory of our case was bullshit. Dustin didn\u2019t threaten me. I was not scared of him. Dustin didn\u2019t make me do anything that night or ever.\u201d The other person on the Justice Department\u2019s execution schedule is Lisa Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row and the first woman set to be federally executed in nearly 70 years. In 2004, Montgomery killed a pregnant woman and then attempted to pass off the baby as her own. Montgomery, who Dunham said has severe mental illness due to an abusive past, was initially scheduled for execution by lethal injection on December 8, but it was delayed due to her lawyers contracting Covid-19.  Trump is the first president in 17 years to reinstate federal executions, despite a recent poll showing that a record-low number of Americans consider the death penalty \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d Even across party lines, the death penalty has been a historically contentious issue. Since the US Supreme Court revived capital punishment in 1976, state governments have been doing most executions, though those have declined in the past two decades, too.  In addition to pushing through federal executions over the past five months, the Justice Department published a new rule to the Federal Register on Friday that would allow the use of other methods for capital punishment. The new regulation reintroduces the use of firing squads and electrocutions for federal executions in addition to lethal injections. The new rule is set to go into effect in 30 days instead of the generally allotted 60 days. As it stands for the remaining inmates awaiting execution, only Higgs appears not to have a method of execution stated on the Justice Department\u2019s schedule \u2014 the rest are marked for lethal injection. The Trump administration\u2019s move, among many others, is another thing President-elect Biden \u2014 who has signaled at various times that he would end the federal death penalty \u2014 will have to face once in office. Biden, a political veteran, has repeatedly addressed criticism during his presidential campaign over the role he played in passing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, also known as the 1994 crime bill, signed by President Bill Clinton. The bill allowed the expansion of crimes eligible for the federal death penalty, which aided the conviction of some of the inmates now awaiting execution. (Hall was only eligible for the death penalty because the crime bill added kidnapping resulting in death to the list of crimes.) The Trump administration is trying to cut corners and fast-track dozens of rules that range from oil-drilling in the Arctic to immigrant restrictions, as well as the death penalty rule, before Biden takes over. If the rules are finalized, the new administration would have to go through a convoluted process to roll them back. But since Biden has pledged to abolish the death penalty at the federal level and incentivize states to follow the federal government\u2019s example, the new death penalty rule may virtually not be of use in his administration.  \u201cUnlike the environmental regulations or policies making it more difficult to negotiate on trade or world safety, the Biden administration can take as much time as it wants to undo this regulation,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cUndoing it isn\u2019t that difficult. I believe the regulation is intended to make it easier for the Trump administration to carry out the remaining lame-duck executions.\u201d The bigger question is how Biden\u2019s administration will transform a historically racist criminal justice system while also healing the wounds brought by the Trump administration.  \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s conduct, when it comes to criminal legal issues, has been highly political, and mostly out of step with the direction that most of the United States is heading,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cWhen push came to shove, it reverted to policies that are more extreme in their cruelty and the arbitrariness of their application than anything else we have seen in modern American history.\u201d  The Trump administration\u2019s push for federal executions, while the country has been preoccupied with the election and the pandemic, is no different.

    "article_text": "The battle over Trump\u2019s huge UAE arms deal, explained On Monday evening, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee met for a classified briefing with Trump administration officials to hear about a proposed $23 billion weapons sale to the United Arab Emirates. Right when it ended, one of the attendees blasted what had transpired behind closed doors. \u201cJust a mind blowing number of unsettled issues and questions the Administration couldn\u2019t answer,\u201d tweeted Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy. \u201cHard to overstate the danger of rushing this though.\u201d That remark underscored the growing political fight over the arms deal announced in early November, a standoff that could severely impact America\u2019s relations with its authoritarian ally and the military balance in the Middle East.  President Donald Trump wants to sell up to 50 F-35 fighter jets, nearly 20 Reaper drones, and around 14,000 bombs and munitions to the UAE \u2014 and he wants to do it before President-elect Joe Biden enters the Oval Office and potentially scuttles the sale.  The administration has explicitly linked the massive arms package to Trump\u2019s broader efforts to counter Iran and to the UAE\u2019s normalization of relations with Israel in August. \u201cThis is in recognition of our deepening relationship and the UAE\u2019s need for advanced defense capabilities to deter and defend itself against heightened threats from Iran,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement announcing his authorization of the sales. \u201cThe UAE\u2019s historic agreement to normalize relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to positively transform the region\u2019s strategic landscape.\u201d But some Republicans and Democrats in Congress, along with certain activist groups, oppose the proposed weapons transfer, saying a country responsible for killing civilians in Yemen and funding Russian mercenaries in Libya doesn\u2019t deserve to be rewarded with even better US-made weapons.  \u201cTo sell such advanced military equipment to the UAE now would be to endorse those policies and threaten US interests and regional stability,\u201d said Seth Binder, an advocacy officer at the Project on Middle East Democracy, who\u2019s leading an effort by arms control organizations and human rights groups to stop the sale. Which means the next 50 days before Biden takes over will see a nasty tussle over one of Trump\u2019s last major foreign policy initiatives, one he\u2019s trying to ram through before the clock runs out. \u201cThis is happening way too fast,\u201d said Michael Hanna, a Middle East security expert at the Century Foundation in New York City. \u201cProcess is important, substance is important, and neither is good here.\u201d The UAE has long wanted advanced fighter jets and top-of-the-line drones, which would make it a greater, more powerful player in the region \u2014 not just militarily, but politically, too. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about going to war here. We\u2019re talking about affecting change in the Middle East,\u201d said Dalia Fahmy, an expert on the UAE\u2019s foreign policy at Long Island University. \u201cThe UAE is reasserting itself in the region. It\u2019s all about being able to leverage that perceived power.\u201d In other words, the UAE wants the world\u2019s most advanced warplane, the F-35, and surveillance and attack drones because it could then throw its weight around in the Middle East. That sounds fine in principle \u2014 after all, most nations seek to increase their power and influence whenever they can. But one big question is how \u2014 and where \u2014 exactly the UAE may try to do that. The sale is \u201cnot helpful [for the US] if there is greater adventurism in Libya or the Horn of Africa,\u201d said a State Department official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to press. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe helpful in a theoretical multilateral framework\u201d against Iran. Both Trump and Biden would certainly rather see the country use the weapons against Iran in case of a war and not, say, to bomb innocent men, women, and children in Yemen, where the UAE is fighting a war as part of a Saudi-led coalition. Figuring out what assurances the US received from the UAE ahead of the sales took up much of Monday\u2019s classified Senate hearing, according to two Senate sources familiar with the discussion.  Murphy\u2019s tweet made clear the answers senators received weren\u2019t satisfactory \u2014 and now he and others are trying to stop the transfers from happening. On November 18, three senators \u2014 Democrats Murphy and Senate Foreign Relations ranking member Robert Menendez, along with Republican Rand Paul \u2014 introduced four joint resolutions to stop the UAE arms deal from happening. \u201cCongress is once again stepping in to serve as a check to avoid putting profit over US national security and that of our allies, and to hopefully prevent a new arms race in the Middle East,\u201d Menendez said in a statement at the time. Those resolutions must be voted on and passed by December 11 or they will expire, clearing Trump\u2019s pathway to the sale. But whether or not the blocking effort works, the resolutions do help make clear the five main arguments against the deal. The first, as mentioned above, is that the UAE could use the weapons indiscriminately, killing civilians in Yemen or elsewhere. Without clear guarantees that that won\u2019t happen, the senators and activists don\u2019t want the measure moving forward. The second concern is that Israel could lose what\u2019s called its \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d (QME) in the Middle East. Simply put, US policy since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war has been to ensure that Israel has more powerful forces than its Arab neighbors. Israel and others fear giving the UAE F-35s and drones might erode that advantage. However, that issue \u201chas receded in importance\u201d more recently, said Barbara Leaf, the US ambassador to the UAE from 2014 to 2018. The main reason is that in October, Israel\u2019s government dropped its objection to the F-35 transfers in particular, soon after the Pentagon promised Jerusalem its edge would remain intact.  \u201cIt\u2019s now more about the foreign policy dimensions of the proposed sale,\u201d Leaf told me. Which brings us to the third objection: that the UAE having this advanced weaponry could change the balance of power in the Middle East, making the Gulf country an even stronger, more influential regional player. If that were the case, experts told me, the UAE might use its newfound strength to attack its enemies, namely Iran, on its own and back other proxies in the area. But some aren\u2019t so worried about that possibility. \u201cThis won\u2019t change the military balance in the Middle East,\u201d said Leaf, now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Washington, DC. \u201cIran\u2019s missile and nonconventional arsenals are formidable and could wreak immense damage, even if the UAE gets the F-35.\u201d The fourth concern is the potential for an arms race. Basically, if the UAE gets a lot of advanced weapons, others \u2014 like Qatar and Iran, the UAE\u2019s adversaries \u2014 might want them, too. At that point, each country may continue to buy more and more weapons until the region becomes increasingly militarized and dangerous. That\u2019s an outcome many experts hope to avoid, although such a possibility remains far off. The fifth worry is that the Trump administration is ramming through in a matter of months a deal that would normally take years to complete. \u201cThis is definitely being rushed through. That\u2019s abnormal and bad practice,\u201d said the Century Foundation\u2019s Hanna. What normally happens is that a deal is painstakingly worked out between the two parties first, then reviewed closely by the State Department and the Pentagon, and then long-term consultations with Congress begin. One item up for debate would be the Israel issue, for example, which could take years to hash out.  In this case, the Trump administration wants to go from an announcement in November to a sale before January 20, the day Biden is sworn in as president. That\u2019s just unheard of, especially for an arms package of this size. That\u2019s why one Senate aide told me they don\u2019t want to see the deal go through before \u201cthey\u2019ve dotted the i\u2019s and crossed the t\u2019s.\u201d Until then, the backlash against the deal is likely to persist.

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s pardon shenanigans are ramping up Outgoing President Donald Trump kicked off what will likely be the first in a series of pardons of his associates last week, with his pardon for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to investigators back in 2017 \u2014 but that\u2019s not all Trump pardoned him for. The typical way pardons work is that the recipient is pardoned for specific crimes. But Flynn\u2019s stands out because it also has preemptive aspects \u2014 that is, it\u2019s written broadly to try to pardon Flynn for possible crimes he hasn\u2019t even been charged with. Preemptive pardons aren\u2019t unprecedented, but they are unusual, and come far closer to a sort of presidential declaration that the president\u2019s associates should be above the law. And Trump\u2019s use of the tactic for Flynn hints at just how far he could go in his final weeks in office. Several of Trump\u2019s former top campaign advisers \u2014 Steve Bannon, Paul Manafort, and Roger Stone \u2014 have been charged with or convicted of specific crimes, for which they could be pardoned. (Trump already commuted Roger Stone\u2019s sentence but has not yet granted him a full pardon.) The universe of potential preemptive pardons, though, is far broader. For while many Trump associates have been charged with crimes, an even greater number have been investigated but have not faced any charges. For instance, there\u2019s the president\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani. The New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman and Michael Schmidt reported Tuesday morning that, \u201cas recently as last week,\u201d Giuliani discussed \u201cthe possibility of receiving a pre-emptive pardon\u201d from Trump (though Giuliani denied this on Twitter). Federal prosecutors in New York have probed Giuliani\u2019s business activities and indicted two of his associates. And some of Trump\u2019s allies are urging him to take preemptive pardons even further. \u201cI\u2019d tell President Trump to pardon yourself and pardon your family,\u201d Fox host Sean Hannity said Monday. It remains unclear whether Trump will try to go that far (particularly, a self-pardon may not be legal and the president can\u2019t pardon state crimes), but it\u2019s clear enough that his lame-duck pardon shenanigans are only getting started.  In December 2017, Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements (lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador). Since then, his case has become a protracted legal saga \u2014 first Flynn tried to withdraw his plea, then a new Justice Department team sought to have the case against Flynn thrown out, and the judge in the case, Emmet Sullivan, has been weighing whether he should permit this latter move. Last week, Trump announced that he had pardoned Flynn, but no documentation for that pardon clarifying its parameters was released until Monday night. Here\u2019s what it looks like: The pardon begins by listing the crime to which Flynn pleaded guilty: making false statements to federal investigators. But it covers a whole lot more than that. Flynn is also pardoned for: So this is not a typical pardon, targeted at crimes someone has actually been charged with or convicted of. It\u2019s a preemptive pardon, designed to shield Flynn from being charged in the future. In that respect, it\u2019s similar to the unconditional preemptive pardon President Gerald Ford granted his former boss and predecessor Richard Nixon \u2014 a sweeping pardon for any criminal offenses Nixon may have committed during the course of his presidency.  The Flynn pardon is not quite as broad as that, but it\u2019s clearly tailored to try to wipe out the possibility that Flynn will face any further charges connected to the current case against him, or in any way related to the Mueller investigation. The New York Times has already confirmed that one preemptive pardon is under discussion \u2014 for Giuliani. Late last year, news broke that federal prosecutors in the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) were scrutinizing Giuliani\u2019s business and finances, exploring his contacts with former top Ukrainian officials, and investigating a host of potential crimes (including obstruction of justice, money laundering, serving as an unregistered agent of a foreign government, mail fraud, and wire fraud).  Two of Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were indicted on charges of campaign finance violations that October. The pair allegedly had been helping Giuliani make connections with Ukrainian officials who claimed to know of scandalous information about the Biden family, that could be helpful to Trump. (The revelation of Trump and Giuliani\u2019s efforts to get dirt on Biden from Ukrainian officials eventually resulted in Trump\u2019s impeachment.) This year, there have been few new developments in the matter. CNN reported that the investigation into Giuliani \u201cwas upended by the coronavirus pandemic, limiting prosecutors\u2019 ability to interview witnesses, collect further evidence, and meet with the grand jury.\u201d Giuliani has not been charged, but if this investigation is serious and still underway, he\u2019d obviously be hoping for a pardon while his client is still in charge of the executive branch. There has also been some discussion \u2014 at least from Sean Hannity \u2014 about preemptive pardons for members of the Trump family.  Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. faced scrutiny in the Mueller investigation but ultimately wasn\u2019t charged. Trump himself also was probed for obstructing justice, but Mueller opted not to charge him, in part because Trump was the sitting president.  President Trump could attempt to pardon himself, but it\u2019s unclear if that would be legal (a popular theory among the #Resistance is that Trump will resign early and let newly installed President Mike Pence pardon him). One issue here, though, is that the president has no power to pardon state crimes \u2014 and he is currently under investigation for potential bank and insurance fraud in New York state.  Now, if Trump truly does plan to run for president again in 2024, he might have political reasons to hold back on the broadest assertions of his pardon powers. Then again, he might feel he\u2019s appropriately laid the groundwork to defend those moves, having disparaged any investigations of himself or anyone close to him as \u201cwitch hunts.\u201d  Finally, there\u2019s been a notable pattern among some who are likely seeking pardons: They\u2019ve tended to champion Trump\u2019s lies and conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Giuliani, of course, has been in charge of Trump\u2019s post-election legal fight, spreading false claims of widespread voter fraud while reportedly seeking a preemptive pardon.  Attorney Sidney Powell \u2014 Flynn\u2019s lawyer \u2014 stood up with Giuliani at a press conference two weeks ago making particularly bizarre claims of fraud. (She asserted that the voting systems company Dominion rigged the vote against Trump, in part because there was \u201ccommunist money\u201d involved and that the company had ties to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.) Powell has filed lawsuits as well filled with similarly false claims. (Flynn himself has said \u201cthere is no doubt in my mind\u201d that Trump won in a \u201clandslide.\u201d) Bannon, too, has been spreading false information advancing Trump\u2019s stolen election narrative, and has been advising Giuliani behind the scenes, according to the Washington Post.  Whether or not there was any explicit quid pro quo involved here, it\u2019s clear that all these people were interested in pardons (in Powell\u2019s case, for her client), and that all these people knew the importance of pleasing the man who could issue those pardons. Indeed, the main champions of Trump\u2019s post-election fraud lies have been people who wanted Trump to pardon somebody \u2014 which is revealing of how much bad faith is at play here.  ",

    "first_p": "",
    "article_text": "The high rate of executions during Trump\u2019s last weeks in office, explained   When five Black and Latino teenagers were wrongfully convicted of the rape of a jogger in New York City\u2019s Central Park in 1989, prominent businessman Donald Trump bought newspaper advertisements calling on New York state to \u201cbring back the death penalty\u201d in the wake of the attack. Little did the country know, Trump\u2019s views on capital punishment then would inform his presidency decades later: In July, the Trump administration reinstated the death penalty at the federal level after a 17-year hiatus. The return of federal executions demonstrates an unprecedented and grim picture of Trump\u2019s legacy in contrast to previous administrations. The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board described it as a \u201csickening spree of executions.\u201d To put it in perspective, only three people had been executed by the federal government in the past 50 years. Meanwhile, in less than five months, eight people have already been put to death by Trump\u2019s Justice Department, with five more executions scheduled to happen before Trump leaves office.  \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s policy regarding a death penalty is just historically abhorrent,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of Death Penalty Information Center, a bipartisan organization that does not take a position for or against the death penalty, but rather is critical of the way capital punishment is administered.  If the remaining executions in December are carried out \u2014 making a total of 10 for 2020 \u2014 it will mark more civilian executions in a single calendar year than any other presidency in the 20th and 21st centuries. \u201cNo one has conducted this number of federal civilian executions in this short period of time in American history,\u201d Dunham added. Of the five upcoming federal executions during the lame-duck period, four of them are Black men, while the fifth will be the first woman to be executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. These federal executions come in concert with the rallying cry for racial justice and an overhaul of America\u2019s policing and criminal justice systems that has left a disproportionate number of Black people arrested, jailed, convicted, and dead. More than 44 percent of the remaining 54 people on federal death row are Black, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, even though Black people make up only 13 percent of the US population.  \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re having a record-high number of federal executions, at the same time that we\u2019re near a record low in state executions, in the middle of a pandemic, shows how much the Trump administration is either out of touch or that it cannot resist gratuitous acts of cruelty,\u201d Dunham said, adding that only seven state executions will occur this year \u2014 the lowest since states began carrying out executions in colonial times. \u201cNobody needs to carry out an execution during a pandemic.\u201d Just last week, the Justice Department also published a rule that would allow other methods for capital punishment, such as firing squads, lethal gas, and electrocutions; Attorney General Bill Barr is currently racing to finalize that rule. Trump\u2019s push for additional methods and a number of federal executions will be part of his presidential legacy and highlights a stark divide between the administration\u2019s actions and dwindling support for the death penalty among Americans. On November 19, Orlando Hall, a Black man sentenced to death for kidnapping, rape, and murder in 1994, became the eighth and latest inmate to be executed by the federal government since it reinstated federal executions this summer. He is also the first in more than a century to be put to death during a lame-duck period. Shortly before Hall was executed by lethal injection, the US Supreme Court had denied his request to stop the execution \u2014 with new Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the majority ruling.  While Hall is the second Black man to be executed out of the eight so far since July, the remaining men scheduled to be put to death are all Black. \u201cIn an apparent effort to forestall criticism that the federal executions were racist, the administration selected white prisoners first,\u201d Dunham said; the executions were reinstated as racial justice protests broke out across the country this summer. \u201cWhat\u2019s striking about that, though, is that it still tells us a lot about whose lives matter because only one of the people executed so far was convicted for killing an African American.\u201d Brandon Bernard, convicted of kidnapping and murder, is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on December 10. Bernard, who is also Black, was only 18 years old when he committed crimes that resulted in the deaths of a young white married couple in 1999. But five of the nine surviving jurors who supported the death penalty at the time now believe it is inappropriate. Even Angela Moore, the federal prosecutor who helped put Bernard on death row, wrote an op-ed in the Indianapolis Star making a case for why the federal government should let him live. \u201cI always took pride in representing the United States as a federal prosecutor, and I think executing Brandon would be a terrible stain on the nation\u2019s honor,\u201d Moore wrote.  During his time in prison, Bernard has been a model prisoner, mentoring at-risk youth. \u201cHaving learned so much since 2000 about the maturation of the human brain and having seen Brandon grow into a humble, remorseful adult fully capable of living peacefully in prison, how can we say he is among that tiny group of offenders who must be put to death?\u201d Moore wrote.  Alfred Bourgeois, a Black truck driver in Texas who was convicted of abusing and killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2002, is scheduled for execution the day after Bernard. Bourgeois\u2019s execution was originally scheduled for January 2020 but was halted by a federal judge who blocked the Trump administration\u2019s early moves to bring back the federal death penalty. Bourgeois\u2019s lawyers then argued to suspend his death sentence on the grounds that he\u2019s entitled to an intellectual disability evaluation under the Eighth Amendment.  The next two inmates on death row are scheduled for execution in 2021 just a few days before Biden\u2019s inauguration. Cory Johnson, who was convicted of murdering seven people during a drug trafficking operation in Richmond, Virginia, is scheduled for lethal injection on January 14. Like Bourgeois, Johnson\u2019s lawyers argue that there is overwhelming evidence that Johnson has intellectual disabilities.  On January 15, Dustin Higgs is scheduled to be put to death for a crime committed in 1996. The Justice Department claims that Higgs kidnapped and murdered three women, but the Daily Beast reports that while he was present at the scene of the crime, witnesses confirm that Higgs did not kill anyone. Co-defendant Willis Haynes fired the shots, but the Justice Department argues that Higgs coerced his friend Haynes into committing the crime.  But Haynes, who was sentenced to life in prison, confirmed through a signed affidavit that Higgs did not coerce him, saying, \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s theory of our case was bullshit. Dustin didn\u2019t threaten me. I was not scared of him. Dustin didn\u2019t make me do anything that night or ever.\u201d The other person on the Justice Department\u2019s execution schedule is Lisa Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row and the first woman set to be federally executed in nearly 70 years. In 2004, Montgomery killed a pregnant woman and then attempted to pass off the baby as her own. Montgomery, who Dunham said has severe mental illness due to an abusive past, was initially scheduled for execution by lethal injection on December 8, but it was delayed due to her lawyers contracting Covid-19.  Trump is the first president in 17 years to reinstate federal executions, despite a recent poll showing that a record-low number of Americans consider the death penalty \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d Even across party lines, the death penalty has been a historically contentious issue. Since the US Supreme Court revived capital punishment in 1976, state governments have been doing most executions, though those have declined in the past two decades, too.  In addition to pushing through federal executions over the past five months, the Justice Department published a new rule to the Federal Register on Friday that would allow the use of other methods for capital punishment. The new regulation reintroduces the use of firing squads and electrocutions for federal executions in addition to lethal injections. The new rule is set to go into effect in 30 days instead of the generally allotted 60 days. As it stands for the remaining inmates awaiting execution, only Higgs appears not to have a method of execution stated on the Justice Department\u2019s schedule \u2014 the rest are marked for lethal injection. The Trump administration\u2019s move, among many others, is another thing President-elect Biden \u2014 who has signaled at various times that he would end the federal death penalty \u2014 will have to face once in office. Biden, a political veteran, has repeatedly addressed criticism during his presidential campaign over the role he played in passing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, also known as the 1994 crime bill, signed by President Bill Clinton. The bill allowed the expansion of crimes eligible for the federal death penalty, which aided the conviction of some of the inmates now awaiting execution. (Hall was only eligible for the death penalty because the crime bill added kidnapping resulting in death to the list of crimes.) The Trump administration is trying to cut corners and fast-track dozens of rules that range from oil-drilling in the Arctic to immigrant restrictions, as well as the death penalty rule, before Biden takes over. If the rules are finalized, the new administration would have to go through a convoluted process to roll them back. But since Biden has pledged to abolish the death penalty at the federal level and incentivize states to follow the federal government\u2019s example, the new death penalty rule may virtually not be of use in his administration.  \u201cUnlike the environmental regulations or policies making it more difficult to negotiate on trade or world safety, the Biden administration can take as much time as it wants to undo this regulation,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cUndoing it isn\u2019t that difficult. I believe the regulation is intended to make it easier for the Trump administration to carry out the remaining lame-duck executions.\u201d The bigger question is how Biden\u2019s administration will transform a historically racist criminal justice system while also healing the wounds brought by the Trump administration.  \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s conduct, when it comes to criminal legal issues, has been highly political, and mostly out of step with the direction that most of the United States is heading,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cWhen push came to shove, it reverted to policies that are more extreme in their cruelty and the arbitrariness of their application than anything else we have seen in modern American history.\u201d  The Trump administration\u2019s push for federal executions, while the country has been preoccupied with the election and the pandemic, is no different.

    "article_text": "Joe Biden should do everything at once Joe Biden will become the US president during an extraordinary moment in history, one that could very well prove to be the calm before the storm, a brief prelude to dissolution and illiberalism. Trump\u2019s bid to become a full-on authoritarian failed, but Democrats could easily lose the House in a 2022 backlash. Biden could face total congressional opposition, even impeachment \u2014 as the recent baseless \u201cstolen election\u201d narrative has shown, if Republicans don\u2019t have any evidence, they\u2019ll just make something up.  Or maybe Democrats will keep the House and take the Senate in 2022, and legislation will become possible! Who knows? (The Georgia Senate runoffs are another big question mark.) If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned over the past five years, it\u2019s that I definitely don\u2019t know what is going to happen next, and it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone else does either. What we do know is that Republicans will wage full-on war on Biden from the second he takes office. They will generate fake conspiracies and controversies through right-wing media and social media. Conservative voters will be told again and again that Biden and Kamala Harris are uniquely dangerous traitors engaged in all sorts of elaborate evil plots. The entire conservative movement, from top to bottom, will view limiting Biden to one term as its primary strategic objective. And the movement will engage in misinformation, norm violation, procedural fuckery, and outright lawbreaking, if necessary, to achieve that objective.  The right will be what it is, what it has been becoming for decades now; expecting anything else would be madness. The question is how the Biden administration should behave, knowing all this. It would be foolish for anyone to claim to have all the answers, or any of the answers really, but in my mind the most pointed lesson about how to behave in a hopelessly partisan environment comes from Donald Trump himself. Before getting to that (suspense!), it\u2019s instructive to take a look back at some of the experiences of the administration for which Biden was vice president. When Barack Obama took office in 2009 in a deepening recession, he expected to receive some Republican help bailing out the economy. It\u2019s easy today to look back on that expectation as naive, but at the time it wasn\u2019t unreasonable. The economy was on the brink of disaster, the need was clear, and the depth of conservative backlash was not yet as evident as it would become later.  What happened instead was a wall of opposition from Republicans, built on bad-faith objections about deficit spending and government waste. With so little room to maneuver, Democrats were forced to negotiate with the tiny handful of moderate Republicans and the large handful of conservative Democrats in the Senate, holding the stimulus bill down to their arbitrary spending caps. In the end, the stimulus bill passed with zero Republican votes in the House and just three in the Senate. The result was an inadequate economic boost and a sluggish recovery that hobbled the rest of Obama\u2019s presidency. Since it was widely agreed that \u201cpolitical capital\u201d was limited and Democrats could only take on one fight at a time, the question then became what to tackle next. The answer proved to be health care reform, perceived as a policy better developed and more widely supported in the Democratic caucus.  In July 2009, Democrats in the House introduced a health care plan based on a system that had been road-tested by Mitt Romney in his recent tenure as governor in Massachusetts. Many Democrats thought the process would take a few months, and then Congress could move on to climate change. Instead, again and again, Republicans lured Democrats into extended negotiations, only to withdraw support at the last minute over some new bad-faith objection (see: \u201cdeath panels\u201d). That left Democrats negotiating with their most conservative members, who did much the same thing (Joe Lieberman, may his name live in infamy). In the end, talks dragged on until March 2010, when Obama finally signed the Affordable Care Act. It got no Republican votes, in the Senate or the House.  Then it was finally time for climate change, and the strategy there was yet more clever sequencing. Obama told Republicans that if they didn\u2019t cooperate on climate change legislation, he would regulate greenhouse gases via the Environmental Protection Agency, which would offer less flexibility and less ability to compensate hard-hit communities. The idea was that the threat of EPA regulations \u2014 made inevitable by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA judgment that carbon dioxide is a pollutant subject to the Clean Air Act \u2014 would frighten Republicans to the legislative table, where they could better defend their interests.  Instead, Republicans vowed implacable opposition to all of it. They would fight furiously against legislation when it was on the table and then fight regulations just as furiously when they came up. To a cool Vulcan mind like Obama\u2019s, it seemed entirely irrational, against Republicans\u2019 own best interests. At that point, he had not fully internalized the extent to which the conservative movement has become unleashed id, driven more by right-wing media than by Republican politicians, fueled by resentment and organized purely to defeat the libs.  In June 2009, when the climate bill passed the House, it got eight Republican votes. By mid-2010, it was dead in the water, with no hope of any Republican votes in the Senate. Democrats no longer had their filibuster-proof 60 seats, and there was nothing like the same support in the caucus that health care reform generated, so it never came to a Senate vote. It ended with a whimper, not a bang. As promised, Obama\u2019s EPA began slowly rolling out regulations, one at a time. It wasn\u2019t until late in his first term that auto mileage standards were finalized and into his second term before EPA got to power plants. Republicans were able to keep Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan tied up in court through the end of his second term. Then Trump took power and began a simultaneous all-fronts assault on Obama\u2019s regulations, unrolling them so fast it was difficult to even keep track. The theme of these stories is that Democrats relied on clever sequencing over and over again, imagining some amount of political capital (\u201ccredibility\u201d) that they could husband and spend strategically to get assistance across the aisle, at every juncture underestimating the ferocity and unanimity of Republican opposition. They kept behaving as though they would find good-faith negotiating partners, as though they were still in the postwar American era of relatively low (or at least manageable) polarization.  What too few of them realized was that they were already in a new era of near-total polarization, with the population sorted into like-minded enclaves, a bifurcated media ecosystem nurturing stacked (and diametrically opposed) \u201cmega-identities,\u201d and voters motivated primarily by \u201cnegative partisanship,\u201d which is to say, hatred of the other side.  A fully polarized two-party system really is a zero-sum game. Any victories or gains by one side come at the other side\u2019s expense, even if the victory secures shared goals. The rational course for the party out of power is to fight with full intensity against everything, always, and that\u2019s what Republicans did under Obama. With scarcely any exceptions, from 2010 through 2020, they pushed in every case for maximal partisan advantage, no matter the stakes or possible cost.  The GOP has failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite a few close calls, but otherwise, its unprincipled pursuit of raw power has paid off handsomely. The party captured state legislatures in 2010 and was able to gerrymander itself minority rule in several states. It practically shut down Congress as a legislative body for six years of Obama\u2019s term. It blocked Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court and for its efforts got Neil Gorsuch. It ignored Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s dying wishes and for its efforts got a 6-3 conservative Court majority that could last for generations.  Republicans blocked so many Democratic judicial nominations that Senate leader Harry Reid had to get rid of the judicial filibuster to keep the courts staffed. Then, when the GOP took control of the presidency and Senate, it used the absence of the filibuster to pack the federal courts full of hyper-ideological, young, often woefully unqualified judges. Rather than paying any price for total partisan warfare, Republicans were rewarded in 2016 with the presidency and both houses of Congress. After carrying the country to the brink of authoritarian crisis, it has now lost the House and the presidency. But Joe Biden has been left to tackle a virtually uncontrolled pandemic and millions of people out of work and on the verge of homelessness or food insecurity.  The GOP will likely retain control of the Senate, which means there will be no adequate economic recovery package and none of Biden\u2019s ambitious campaign plans will come to fruition. It has kept control of key state legislatures, so it will be able to gerrymander itself an advantage for another decade. The elections of 2022 will be another partisan brawl, and the odds are stacked against Democrats; the president\u2019s party has lost seats in every first-term midterm in the past 100 years, save three. If Republicans gain full control of Congress, impeachment becomes a real possibility, even if conviction is very unlikely. It\u2019s a grim situation, and Biden is starting out behind the eight-ball. How should he proceed? Here we return to the lesson that Trump has to teach Biden about life in hyperpolarized politics.  To wit: blitz. Do everything at once. No matter what the Biden administration does, it will be accused of socialism and corruption by the right. And the past several years have richly demonstrated that conservative parts of the country, particularly rural areas and low-density suburbs, are almost completely captured by right-wing media, from Fox on the TV to AM conservative radio to Sinclair-owned local news to the profusion of shady Facebook sources and groups, where misinformation is rapid and rampant.  Democrats badly need to address this media asymmetry. Despite what conservatives have convinced themselves, mainstream media outlets like CNN are not analogous to Fox, and Democrats have no comparable radio, local TV, or social media operations to carry their messages and narratives straight to voters where they live.  But that is long-term work, and 2022 is right around the corner.  The only thing Biden will have real control over is his administration and what it does. And his North Star, his organizing principle, should be doing as much good on as many fronts as fast as possible. Blitz. By constantly blundering forward, Trump has helped chart which US institutions and norms provide real resistance and which don\u2019t. The courts have tangibly restrained Trump; they have been the primary bulwark against him. But the chattering of the media and the political classes? Moral outrage? Precedent and tradition? Civil protest?  All of these have proven gossamer. Trump charged right through them like they were cotton candy. By constantly acting, being on the offensive, generating new stories and controversies, he simply overwhelmed the ability of the system to fasten on any one thing.  Biden should learn the lesson. All that matters is what gets done, put on paper and into law. The rest is vapor. The administration should staff up as rapidly as possible with ambitious young progressives and tell every single civil servant that the next two years are going to be a full sprint. Start immediately rewriting and reimplementing the environmental, public health, and worker safety regulations Trump has weakened. Reverse his immigration policies. Drop his lawsuits.  Reassess the social cost of carbon. Replace Trump\u2019s weak Affordable Clean Energy rule with more stringent carbon rules for the power sector. Ditch EPA\u2019s \u201csecret science\u201d rule and restock scientific advisory boards with actual scientists. Put a moratorium on new oil and gas drilling leases on public land. Pledge the purchasing power of the federal government \u2014 around $500 billion a year \u2014 toward clean energy technology.  Through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), direct federal financing toward carbon reduction and clean energy across agencies. Use the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to reject regulations from any agency that do not include both a climate and equity \u201cscreen\u201d to ensure that they reduce emissions and help the most vulnerable. Use the powers conferred by the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill to integrate climate risks into the financial system.  I\u2019ve written more about what Biden can do on climate change without Congress. Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews took a wider policy view with 10 big things Biden can do with executive powers, from forgiving student loan debt to reigning in factory farming. More ideas can be found here, here, here, and here, among other places. There\u2019s no shortage of ways for Biden to deploy the powers of the presidency, and he should maximize every one of them. All of these moves will elicit howls of outrage and court challenges from the right. Many will also infuriate the left, since they will inevitably fall short of Biden\u2019s grand campaign promises.  Biden can\u2019t control any of that. Doing less, negotiating more, relying on clever sequencing, chasing after receding promises of cooperation \u2014 none of that will solve anything, any more than it did for Obama. He can reach across the aisle, make it clear his door is open, but he shouldn\u2019t wait around for anyone to walk in. Biden\u2019s best chance is to try to overwhelm the system the way Trump did, by doing so much that it\u2019s impossible to make any one thing into a lasting story. He should launch so many simultaneous reforms that there\u2019s no time for right-wing media to make up lies about all of them or for the Supreme Court to hear them all. He should ignore bad-faith attacks and stay relentlessly on message about what\u2019s gotten done and what\u2019s getting done next. He should, at every juncture, get caught trying to make government work better for ordinary people. To succeed, all this must happen alongside Democratic Party efforts to improve messaging and media, get persistent party infrastructure on the ground in communities the party has neglected, and innovate on voter outreach and persuasion. (Aaron Strauss has some good ideas on that front.) But Biden has something the rest of the party at the federal level does not have: the power to improve Americans\u2019 lives in a visible way. More than anything else, cynicism about government\u2019s ability to do that is corroding US politics. The best thing Biden can do, morally and politically, is act, as much and as fast as possible, and then talk about it, and do more of it, and talk about it more. (And he should be clear about exactly who stands in the way of bigger, better changes, and why his name is Mitch McConnell.) The rest of it, he should ignore: the Washington chatter about the latest Republican accusations or catty infighting among Democratic factions, the cable news story or Twitter drama of the day, the latest offensive thing Trump or some Trump surrogate said, all of it. Bulldoze through it. The president has limited ability to control political discourse and drama, but he has an enormous capacity to change policy and direct resources. Biden should use that power while he has it, without hesitation or apology.",

    "first_p": "",
    "article_text": "The high rate of executions during Trump\u2019s last weeks in office, explained   When five Black and Latino teenagers were wrongfully convicted of the rape of a jogger in New York City\u2019s Central Park in 1989, prominent businessman Donald Trump bought newspaper advertisements calling on New York state to \u201cbring back the death penalty\u201d in the wake of the attack. Little did the country know, Trump\u2019s views on capital punishment then would inform his presidency decades later: In July, the Trump administration reinstated the death penalty at the federal level after a 17-year hiatus. The return of federal executions demonstrates an unprecedented and grim picture of Trump\u2019s legacy in contrast to previous administrations. The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board described it as a \u201csickening spree of executions.\u201d To put it in perspective, only three people had been executed by the federal government in the past 50 years. Meanwhile, in less than five months, eight people have already been put to death by Trump\u2019s Justice Department, with five more executions scheduled to happen before Trump leaves office.  \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s policy regarding a death penalty is just historically abhorrent,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of Death Penalty Information Center, a bipartisan organization that does not take a position for or against the death penalty, but rather is critical of the way capital punishment is administered.  If the remaining executions in December are carried out \u2014 making a total of 10 for 2020 \u2014 it will mark more civilian executions in a single calendar year than any other presidency in the 20th and 21st centuries. \u201cNo one has conducted this number of federal civilian executions in this short period of time in American history,\u201d Dunham added. Of the five upcoming federal executions during the lame-duck period, four of them are Black men, while the fifth will be the first woman to be executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. These federal executions come in concert with the rallying cry for racial justice and an overhaul of America\u2019s policing and criminal justice systems that has left a disproportionate number of Black people arrested, jailed, convicted, and dead. More than 44 percent of the remaining 54 people on federal death row are Black, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, even though Black people make up only 13 percent of the US population.  \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re having a record-high number of federal executions, at the same time that we\u2019re near a record low in state executions, in the middle of a pandemic, shows how much the Trump administration is either out of touch or that it cannot resist gratuitous acts of cruelty,\u201d Dunham said, adding that only seven state executions will occur this year \u2014 the lowest since states began carrying out executions in colonial times. \u201cNobody needs to carry out an execution during a pandemic.\u201d Just last week, the Justice Department also published a rule that would allow other methods for capital punishment, such as firing squads, lethal gas, and electrocutions; Attorney General Bill Barr is currently racing to finalize that rule. Trump\u2019s push for additional methods and a number of federal executions will be part of his presidential legacy and highlights a stark divide between the administration\u2019s actions and dwindling support for the death penalty among Americans. On November 19, Orlando Hall, a Black man sentenced to death for kidnapping, rape, and murder in 1994, became the eighth and latest inmate to be executed by the federal government since it reinstated federal executions this summer. He is also the first in more than a century to be put to death during a lame-duck period. Shortly before Hall was executed by lethal injection, the US Supreme Court had denied his request to stop the execution \u2014 with new Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the majority ruling.  While Hall is the second Black man to be executed out of the eight so far since July, the remaining men scheduled to be put to death are all Black. \u201cIn an apparent effort to forestall criticism that the federal executions were racist, the administration selected white prisoners first,\u201d Dunham said; the executions were reinstated as racial justice protests broke out across the country this summer. \u201cWhat\u2019s striking about that, though, is that it still tells us a lot about whose lives matter because only one of the people executed so far was convicted for killing an African American.\u201d Brandon Bernard, convicted of kidnapping and murder, is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on December 10. Bernard, who is also Black, was only 18 years old when he committed crimes that resulted in the deaths of a young white married couple in 1999. But five of the nine surviving jurors who supported the death penalty at the time now believe it is inappropriate. Even Angela Moore, the federal prosecutor who helped put Bernard on death row, wrote an op-ed in the Indianapolis Star making a case for why the federal government should let him live. \u201cI always took pride in representing the United States as a federal prosecutor, and I think executing Brandon would be a terrible stain on the nation\u2019s honor,\u201d Moore wrote.  During his time in prison, Bernard has been a model prisoner, mentoring at-risk youth. \u201cHaving learned so much since 2000 about the maturation of the human brain and having seen Brandon grow into a humble, remorseful adult fully capable of living peacefully in prison, how can we say he is among that tiny group of offenders who must be put to death?\u201d Moore wrote.  Alfred Bourgeois, a Black truck driver in Texas who was convicted of abusing and killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2002, is scheduled for execution the day after Bernard. Bourgeois\u2019s execution was originally scheduled for January 2020 but was halted by a federal judge who blocked the Trump administration\u2019s early moves to bring back the federal death penalty. Bourgeois\u2019s lawyers then argued to suspend his death sentence on the grounds that he\u2019s entitled to an intellectual disability evaluation under the Eighth Amendment.  The next two inmates on death row are scheduled for execution in 2021 just a few days before Biden\u2019s inauguration. Cory Johnson, who was convicted of murdering seven people during a drug trafficking operation in Richmond, Virginia, is scheduled for lethal injection on January 14. Like Bourgeois, Johnson\u2019s lawyers argue that there is overwhelming evidence that Johnson has intellectual disabilities.  On January 15, Dustin Higgs is scheduled to be put to death for a crime committed in 1996. The Justice Department claims that Higgs kidnapped and murdered three women, but the Daily Beast reports that while he was present at the scene of the crime, witnesses confirm that Higgs did not kill anyone. Co-defendant Willis Haynes fired the shots, but the Justice Department argues that Higgs coerced his friend Haynes into committing the crime.  But Haynes, who was sentenced to life in prison, confirmed through a signed affidavit that Higgs did not coerce him, saying, \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s theory of our case was bullshit. Dustin didn\u2019t threaten me. I was not scared of him. Dustin didn\u2019t make me do anything that night or ever.\u201d The other person on the Justice Department\u2019s execution schedule is Lisa Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row and the first woman set to be federally executed in nearly 70 years. In 2004, Montgomery killed a pregnant woman and then attempted to pass off the baby as her own. Montgomery, who Dunham said has severe mental illness due to an abusive past, was initially scheduled for execution by lethal injection on December 8, but it was delayed due to her lawyers contracting Covid-19.  Trump is the first president in 17 years to reinstate federal executions, despite a recent poll showing that a record-low number of Americans consider the death penalty \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d Even across party lines, the death penalty has been a historically contentious issue. Since the US Supreme Court revived capital punishment in 1976, state governments have been doing most executions, though those have declined in the past two decades, too.  In addition to pushing through federal executions over the past five months, the Justice Department published a new rule to the Federal Register on Friday that would allow the use of other methods for capital punishment. The new regulation reintroduces the use of firing squads and electrocutions for federal executions in addition to lethal injections. The new rule is set to go into effect in 30 days instead of the generally allotted 60 days. As it stands for the remaining inmates awaiting execution, only Higgs appears not to have a method of execution stated on the Justice Department\u2019s schedule \u2014 the rest are marked for lethal injection. The Trump administration\u2019s move, among many others, is another thing President-elect Biden \u2014 who has signaled at various times that he would end the federal death penalty \u2014 will have to face once in office. Biden, a political veteran, has repeatedly addressed criticism during his presidential campaign over the role he played in passing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, also known as the 1994 crime bill, signed by President Bill Clinton. The bill allowed the expansion of crimes eligible for the federal death penalty, which aided the conviction of some of the inmates now awaiting execution. (Hall was only eligible for the death penalty because the crime bill added kidnapping resulting in death to the list of crimes.) The Trump administration is trying to cut corners and fast-track dozens of rules that range from oil-drilling in the Arctic to immigrant restrictions, as well as the death penalty rule, before Biden takes over. If the rules are finalized, the new administration would have to go through a convoluted process to roll them back. But since Biden has pledged to abolish the death penalty at the federal level and incentivize states to follow the federal government\u2019s example, the new death penalty rule may virtually not be of use in his administration.  \u201cUnlike the environmental regulations or policies making it more difficult to negotiate on trade or world safety, the Biden administration can take as much time as it wants to undo this regulation,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cUndoing it isn\u2019t that difficult. I believe the regulation is intended to make it easier for the Trump administration to carry out the remaining lame-duck executions.\u201d The bigger question is how Biden\u2019s administration will transform a historically racist criminal justice system while also healing the wounds brought by the Trump administration.  \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s conduct, when it comes to criminal legal issues, has been highly political, and mostly out of step with the direction that most of the United States is heading,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cWhen push came to shove, it reverted to policies that are more extreme in their cruelty and the arbitrariness of their application than anything else we have seen in modern American history.\u201d  The Trump administration\u2019s push for federal executions, while the country has been preoccupied with the election and the pandemic, is no different.

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s pardon shenanigans are ramping up Outgoing President Donald Trump kicked off what will likely be the first in a series of pardons of his associates last week, with his pardon for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to investigators back in 2017 \u2014 but that\u2019s not all Trump pardoned him for. The typical way pardons work is that the recipient is pardoned for specific crimes. But Flynn\u2019s stands out because it also has preemptive aspects \u2014 that is, it\u2019s written broadly to try to pardon Flynn for possible crimes he hasn\u2019t even been charged with. Preemptive pardons aren\u2019t unprecedented, but they are unusual, and come far closer to a sort of presidential declaration that the president\u2019s associates should be above the law. And Trump\u2019s use of the tactic for Flynn hints at just how far he could go in his final weeks in office. Several of Trump\u2019s former top campaign advisers \u2014 Steve Bannon, Paul Manafort, and Roger Stone \u2014 have been charged with or convicted of specific crimes, for which they could be pardoned. (Trump already commuted Roger Stone\u2019s sentence but has not yet granted him a full pardon.) The universe of potential preemptive pardons, though, is far broader. For while many Trump associates have been charged with crimes, an even greater number have been investigated but have not faced any charges. For instance, there\u2019s the president\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani. The New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman and Michael Schmidt reported Tuesday morning that, \u201cas recently as last week,\u201d Giuliani discussed \u201cthe possibility of receiving a pre-emptive pardon\u201d from Trump (though Giuliani denied this on Twitter). Federal prosecutors in New York have probed Giuliani\u2019s business activities and indicted two of his associates. And some of Trump\u2019s allies are urging him to take preemptive pardons even further. \u201cI\u2019d tell President Trump to pardon yourself and pardon your family,\u201d Fox host Sean Hannity said Monday. It remains unclear whether Trump will try to go that far (particularly, a self-pardon may not be legal and the president can\u2019t pardon state crimes), but it\u2019s clear enough that his lame-duck pardon shenanigans are only getting started.  In December 2017, Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements (lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador). Since then, his case has become a protracted legal saga \u2014 first Flynn tried to withdraw his plea, then a new Justice Department team sought to have the case against Flynn thrown out, and the judge in the case, Emmet Sullivan, has been weighing whether he should permit this latter move. Last week, Trump announced that he had pardoned Flynn, but no documentation for that pardon clarifying its parameters was released until Monday night. Here\u2019s what it looks like: The pardon begins by listing the crime to which Flynn pleaded guilty: making false statements to federal investigators. But it covers a whole lot more than that. Flynn is also pardoned for: So this is not a typical pardon, targeted at crimes someone has actually been charged with or convicted of. It\u2019s a preemptive pardon, designed to shield Flynn from being charged in the future. In that respect, it\u2019s similar to the unconditional preemptive pardon President Gerald Ford granted his former boss and predecessor Richard Nixon \u2014 a sweeping pardon for any criminal offenses Nixon may have committed during the course of his presidency.  The Flynn pardon is not quite as broad as that, but it\u2019s clearly tailored to try to wipe out the possibility that Flynn will face any further charges connected to the current case against him, or in any way related to the Mueller investigation. The New York Times has already confirmed that one preemptive pardon is under discussion \u2014 for Giuliani. Late last year, news broke that federal prosecutors in the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) were scrutinizing Giuliani\u2019s business and finances, exploring his contacts with former top Ukrainian officials, and investigating a host of potential crimes (including obstruction of justice, money laundering, serving as an unregistered agent of a foreign government, mail fraud, and wire fraud).  Two of Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were indicted on charges of campaign finance violations that October. The pair allegedly had been helping Giuliani make connections with Ukrainian officials who claimed to know of scandalous information about the Biden family, that could be helpful to Trump. (The revelation of Trump and Giuliani\u2019s efforts to get dirt on Biden from Ukrainian officials eventually resulted in Trump\u2019s impeachment.) This year, there have been few new developments in the matter. CNN reported that the investigation into Giuliani \u201cwas upended by the coronavirus pandemic, limiting prosecutors\u2019 ability to interview witnesses, collect further evidence, and meet with the grand jury.\u201d Giuliani has not been charged, but if this investigation is serious and still underway, he\u2019d obviously be hoping for a pardon while his client is still in charge of the executive branch. There has also been some discussion \u2014 at least from Sean Hannity \u2014 about preemptive pardons for members of the Trump family.  Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. faced scrutiny in the Mueller investigation but ultimately wasn\u2019t charged. Trump himself also was probed for obstructing justice, but Mueller opted not to charge him, in part because Trump was the sitting president.  President Trump could attempt to pardon himself, but it\u2019s unclear if that would be legal (a popular theory among the #Resistance is that Trump will resign early and let newly installed President Mike Pence pardon him). One issue here, though, is that the president has no power to pardon state crimes \u2014 and he is currently under investigation for potential bank and insurance fraud in New York state.  Now, if Trump truly does plan to run for president again in 2024, he might have political reasons to hold back on the broadest assertions of his pardon powers. Then again, he might feel he\u2019s appropriately laid the groundwork to defend those moves, having disparaged any investigations of himself or anyone close to him as \u201cwitch hunts.\u201d  Finally, there\u2019s been a notable pattern among some who are likely seeking pardons: They\u2019ve tended to champion Trump\u2019s lies and conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Giuliani, of course, has been in charge of Trump\u2019s post-election legal fight, spreading false claims of widespread voter fraud while reportedly seeking a preemptive pardon.  Attorney Sidney Powell \u2014 Flynn\u2019s lawyer \u2014 stood up with Giuliani at a press conference two weeks ago making particularly bizarre claims of fraud. (She asserted that the voting systems company Dominion rigged the vote against Trump, in part because there was \u201ccommunist money\u201d involved and that the company had ties to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.) Powell has filed lawsuits as well filled with similarly false claims. (Flynn himself has said \u201cthere is no doubt in my mind\u201d that Trump won in a \u201clandslide.\u201d) Bannon, too, has been spreading false information advancing Trump\u2019s stolen election narrative, and has been advising Giuliani behind the scenes, according to the Washington Post.  Whether or not there was any explicit quid pro quo involved here, it\u2019s clear that all these people were interested in pardons (in Powell\u2019s case, for her client), and that all these people knew the importance of pleasing the man who could issue those pardons. Indeed, the main champions of Trump\u2019s post-election fraud lies have been people who wanted Trump to pardon somebody \u2014 which is revealing of how much bad faith is at play here.  ",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the election result has sputtered out President Donald Trump still has not conceded his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden, but his bid to overturn the election results has sputtered out over the past week. The lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors. Trump is still, of course, trying his best to cast doubt on the results by making false claims of large-scale voter fraud. His latest gimmick is that his legal team is working with sympathetic Republican legislators in key states to hold press events touting supposed election irregularities. But no GOP-controlled legislature in a state Biden won seems to be making a serious push to overturn the result (a move that would entail many practical and legal obstacles). But the deadline in federal law for states to finalize their results is December 8 \u2014 Tuesday of next week. Then, the members of the Electoral College will meet (separately in each state) to cast their votes on December 14 \u2014 in just under two weeks. They are set to cast the votes that will officially make Biden the next president. And Trump has not yet been able to succeed in interfering with that process. There were six key swing states where Biden won by small margins, where Trump had hoped to interfere with the certification of results (certification is when a state makes its results official). Four of those six states \u2014 Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada \u2014 certified their results over the past week and a half, with Biden as the winner. The fifth and sixth, Arizona and Wisconsin, certified Biden\u2019s victory on Monday. Trump made political, procedural, and legal attempts to try and delay or interfere with these certifications, but these efforts have uniformly failed. Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, spurned the Trump team\u2019s attempts to get him to endorse fictitious claims of widespread voter fraud in the state. In Michigan, Trump allies\u2019 attempts to get two Republicans on the state board of canvassers to  block certification for similar reasons failed last week (one of them backed it).  In most of the other states, the key officials in charge of certifying results were Democrats, so Trump could only hope that a judge would step in and block certification. None have \u2014 so the Trump team\u2019s lawsuits flopped. Recounts have also failed to change the outcome. Wisconsin\u2019s recount of two counties has concluded, and Biden\u2019s lead of about 20,000 votes expanded by 87 votes. Georgia\u2019s new machine recount is still ongoing, but it isn\u2019t expected to change Biden\u2019s 12,000-vote lead since the ballots have already been audited by hand. After states certify their results, the next step in the process is that the electors are appointed. And this is key \u2014 the electors are the 538 people who compose the Electoral College and cast the votes that will officially determine the next president.  If Biden wins a state, he is entitled to have his chosen slate of people appointed as the electors for that state. But some Republicans have embraced the theory that the Constitution empowers state legislatures to ignore the outcome of the vote in their states and appoint whoever they want as electors instead.  Any effort to do this would run afoul of various state laws and arguably federal law as well. Legislators would essentially be asserting that the power granted them by the Constitution allows them to ignore these existing laws.  Some GOP state legislators have indeed come out in support of this, such as Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano (who met with Trump last week before abruptly leaving the meeting after he was informed he had tested positive for Covid-19). But GOP state legislative leaders have not come out in support of this effort, and most have outright said they won\u2019t. Pennsylvania\u2019s legislative leaders have no plans to put this on their legislative agenda. And Michigan\u2019s Republican leaders left a meeting with Trump earlier this month and said they would \u201cfollow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan\u2019s electors.\u201d And even though Trump\u2019s legal team worked with allied legislators in Pennsylvania and Arizona to hold purported \u201chearings\u201d about election irregularities in recent days, those weren\u2019t official legislative hearings \u2014 they were essentially press stunts.  So with neither the officials in charge of certifications nor Republican state legislative leaders willing to try to steal the election for Trump, it looks like the president\u2019s attempt to do just that is dead in the water.

    "article_text": "Even Amy Coney Barrett appears skeptical of Trump\u2019s latest attempt to rig the census If the Supreme Court decides to actually decide Trump v. New York, a case asking if President Trump can exclude undocumented immigrants from the 2020 census count, Trump is very likely to lose.  Both Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett appeared very skeptical of acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall\u2019s attempt to defend Trump\u2019s policy, which is unambiguously unconstitutional, during Monday\u2019s oral arguments. Add in the three liberal justices, and that\u2019s a majority of the Court that may be opposed to Trump\u2019s policy. Only Justice Samuel Alito offered much of a defense of it, so it\u2019s possible a ruling will be more lopsided than a 5-4 ruling. But the case is procedurally very messy. Several justices expressed doubts that the Court has jurisdiction to hear it now, though they could potentially take it up again after the census is finalized.  It\u2019s also unclear whether the Court should rule on this case on the expedited schedule originally proposed by Trump\u2019s Justice Department. The Justice Department had asked for the case to be decided before a December 31 statutory deadline to transmit the results of the 2020 census to Trump. But Wall seemed to concede early in Monday\u2019s arguments that the Commerce Department is \u201cnot currently on pace\u201d for that milestone, so Trump may not be able to meet a January 10 deadline to inform Congress of the new census\u2019s impact on representation in the US House of Representatives. President-elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, becomes president at noon on January 20. And once he becomes president, he can render this case moot by rescinding Trump\u2019s policy excluding undocumented immigrants from the census, assuming that the census has not been finalized by that point. The Trump administration, in other words, appears to be engaged in a disorganized race against the clock to implement an unconstitutional policy before Trump\u2019s term expires. And the justices appear uncertain about whether to end it now, or whether to let it play out and potentially invalidate Trump\u2019s policy later. The New York case turns on a memorandum Trump issued in July, which provides that \u201cfor the purpose of the reapportionment of Representatives following the 2020 census, it is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status.\u201d Thus, if Trump gets his way, undocumented immigrants will not be counted when House representation is doled out to each of the 50 states following the census. About 10.6 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States, and nearly 20 percent live in California. So the nation\u2019s largest blue state could lose as many as three House seats if Trump succeeds in his plans to cut these immigrants out of the apportionment count. (The Republican-leaning state of Texas could also be hit hard, but Texas\u2019s Republican legislature is likely to draw gerrymandered maps that would impose the cost of any lost House seats on Democrats. California, by contrast, uses a bipartisan redistricting commission to draw legislative lines.) Trump\u2019s memo violates the unambiguous text of the Constitution. Under the 14th Amendment, \u201crepresentatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.\u201d Undocumented immigrants are \u201cpersons.\u201d To get around this constitutional requirement, Trump claims that the 14th Amendment should not be read literally. \u201cAlthough the Constitution requires the \u2018persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed,\u2019 to be enumerated in the census,\u201d Trump says in his memo, \u201cthat requirement has never been understood to include in the apportionment base every individual physically present within a State\u2019s boundaries at the time of the census.\u201d On this narrow point, Trump is correct. There are some foreign nationals, such as tourists and foreign diplomats, who generally are not counted by the census, even if they are physically present when the census is being taken. \u201cThe term \u2018persons in each State,\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s memo notes, \u201chas been interpreted to mean that only the \u2018inhabitants\u2019 of each State should be included.\u201d Yet, while Trump is largely correct that only \u201cinhabitants\u201d of a state are counted for purposes of the census, Trump then claims a broad power to determine who counts as an inhabitant and who does not \u2014 and then he wields this assumed power to insist that undocumented immigrants are not inhabitants of the state where they reside. But this claim cannot be squared with the meaning of the word \u201cinhabitant.\u201d As the lower court that ruled against Trump in New York held, \u201cit does not follow that illegal aliens \u2014 a category defined by legal status, not residence \u2014 can be excluded\u201d from the census by claiming that they are not \u201cinhabitants\u201d of a state. \u201cTo the contrary,\u201d the court explained, while quoting from Merriam-Webster\u2019s dictionary, \u201cthe ordinary definition of the term \u2018inhabitant\u2019 is \u2018one that occupies a particular place regularly, routinely, or for a period of time.\u2019\u201d Many undocumented immigrants reside in a state for \u201cmany years or even decades,\u201d the court continued. Such individuals are clearly \u201cinhabitants\u201d of the state where they live, even if they are not lawfully present. Trump\u2019s newest appointee to the Court, Barrett, offered a forceful rebuttal to the attempt to defend Trump\u2019s policy. \u201cA lot of the historical evidence and longstanding practice really cuts against your position,\u201d Barrett told Wall. She added that there is evidence that \u201cin the founding era, an \u2018inhabitant\u2019 was a dweller, who lives and resides in a place.\u201d  Thus, an immigrant who has resided in a state for many months or years \u2014 or even one who has only lived there briefly \u2014 would count as an \u201cinhabitant.\u201d Kavanaugh, another Trump appointee, also said that he believes there are \u201cforceful constitutional and statutory arguments\u201d against Trump\u2019s position. So it is very likely that a majority of the Court will vote to reject Trump\u2019s policy \u2014 if, that is, the Court decides this case at all. The policy laid out in Trump\u2019s July memo is categorical. The memo states that \u201cit is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status.\u201d So, the memo suggests that any undocumented immigrant should be excluded from the census for apportionment purposes. But acting Solicitor General Wall spent time in oral arguments claiming that the administration isn\u2019t sure how many undocumented immigrants it will be able to identify, or whether Trump will try to exclude more than a \u201csubset\u201d of the estimated 10-11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. This subset, which might only include immigrants who are currently being detained with an eye towards removal, could be much smaller than the total number of undocumented immigrants in the country. The reason why the question of how many immigrants will be excluded matters is because of a doctrine known as \u201cstanding.\u201d Broadly speaking, a plaintiff may not challenge a federal policy unless they can show that there is a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that they will be injured by that policy. As a general rule, a state has standing to challenge a census-related policy if they are likely to lose House seats under that policy. But it is far more likely that one of the plaintiff states will lose representation if millions of undocumented immigrants are excluded from the census than if only maybe tens of thousands of immigrants are excluded. For this reason, several justices suggested that maybe the Court should wait to decide this case until after we know how many immigrants Trump will exclude. If the Court goes down that path, it\u2019s unclear what happens next. As noted above, Trump might not manage to send the final House appointment results to Congress before he leaves office. So the justices could be able to sit on this case until January 20, let President Biden rescind Trump\u2019s memo, and then declare the case moot. Alternatively, the Court could dismiss the case, let Trump do whatever he is going to do, and then the plaintiff states could file a new lawsuit as soon as Trump sends his apportionment results to Congress. Under this alternative outcome, Trump would win a temporary victory, but Trump\u2019s policy would still most likely fall victim to future litigation. Kavanaugh and Barrett also appeared to entertain a third possibility. The Court could strike down the categorical exclusion of undocumented immigrants laid out in Trump\u2019s July memorandum, but they could also permit Trump to issue a new memorandum that might exclude certain subcategories of undocumented immigrants (such as people currently in immigration detention). The plaintiff states could then file a new lawsuit challenging the legality of that new memorandum. In any event, it appears unlikely that Trump\u2019s original policy will stand. There appear to be at least five Supreme Court members \u2014 and potentially more than five \u2014 who think that Trump does not have the power to categorically exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment count. The open question is whether the Court will decide this case quickly, or whether they will string this case out, potentially raising a cloud of uncertainty over the apportionment process for months or more. Such a cloud could have significant costs, as it will cut into the time that states need to use to draw new congressional maps using the new census data. But, at the very least, Trump\u2019s unconstitutional policy looks likely to fall \u2014 eventually.",

    "article_text": "Ajit Pai, Trump\u2019s FCC chair who repealed net neutrality, is leaving on January 20 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Ajit Pai has announced that he will leave the agency on January 20, when Joe Biden is sworn in as president. This gives Biden at least one commissioner slot to fill on his first day in office and, should that choice be confirmed, a Democrat majority to fulfill his vision of what the FCC should be and do for the next four years. Pai\u2019s controversial tenure as FCC chair has been marked by business-friendly deregulation that helped media conglomerates get even bigger while doing little for lower-income people who couldn\u2019t afford internet access \u2014 which has become an even more essential service during the pandemic. Pai also awarded billions of dollars in subsidies to broadband companies for providing internet access to remote locations, an investment of public dollars to close the digital divide that red state lawmakers found especially beneficial. \u201cIt has been the honor of a lifetime to serve at the Federal Communications Commission, including as Chairman of the FCC over the past four years,\u201d Pai said in a statement. \u201cI am grateful to President Trump for giving me the opportunity to lead the agency in 2017, to President Obama for appointing me as a Commissioner in 2012, and to Senate Majority Leader McConnell and the Senate for twice confirming me. To be the first Asian-American to chair the FCC has been a particular privilege. As I often say: only in America.\u201d \u201cWhile we did not always agree on policy matters, I always valued our shared commitment to public service,\u201d Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic FCC commissioner who is likely to become the acting chair when Biden takes office, said in a statement. Geoffrey Starks, the other Democrat on the commission, issued a similar if slightly less formal statement: \u201cChairman Pai and I may disagree on many policy issues, but we are in full agreement about two things: the outstanding quality of the FCC\u2019s staff and the tremendous abilities of Patrick Mahomes.\u201d Pai, a Republican, joined the FCC after working for Verizon, a fact he used to gleefully troll his Democratic colleagues who were concerned about Pai\u2019s ties to the company. And since he\u2019d been granted a second five-year term by President Trump in 2017, Pai could have stayed on as a commissioner until that term expired, but it\u2019s customary for chairs to leave the agency when a new administration comes in. The FCC is considered to be an independent agency with five commissioners (no more than three of whom can be from one political party) who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.  Under Pai, the FCC set about deregulating the industries under its purview as much as possible and reversing landmark Obama-era decisions. The net neutrality repeal is probably the most well-known example of both. During the Obama years, the FCC reclassified internet service providers (ISPs) as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act, giving the agency more authority over them and forcing ISPs to treat all internet traffic the same. That would mean, for instance, that ISPs couldn\u2019t charge more for certain types of traffic or restrict access to certain websites. Pai was a vocal opponent of this policy as a commissioner under Obama, and repealed it as soon as he possibly could after taking over as chair.  Pai\u2019s reasoning was that such regulations would hamper investment and growth in a burgeoning industry (whether or not the internet can still be considered a burgeoning industry is up for debate). Pai called for a \u201clight touch framework,\u201d akin to the Clinton administration\u2019s approach from decades earlier (when the internet truly was a burgeoning industry).  This light-touch framework gave the FCC little recourse when the pandemic hit. The crisis left millions of Americans to rely on the internet more than ever, but they had fewer protections from exploitive rate increases or sudden service cuts. Pai\u2019s initiatives to reduce fraud in the agency\u2019s universal lifeline service, which subsidizes phone and internet for lower-income people, made it harder for people who actually needed it to qualify for and stay in the program, and his actions reduced the number of companies that could provide it. The $9.25 internet service subsidy also didn\u2019t cover the cost of most people\u2019s vastly increased data needs. Pai\u2019s solutions to these problems included asking broadband companies not to cut off subscribers who couldn\u2019t pay their bills during the first few months of the pandemic, and to pause lifeline service de-enrollment temporarily. However, Pai refused to extend the E-Rate program, which gives educational institutions heavily discounted internet and telecommunications services, to the private homes that became classrooms when the pandemic shut schools and libraries down. One of Pai\u2019s last acts for the agency will likely be his attempt to use Title II to assert the FCC\u2019s authority over internet service providers, platforms, and sites by \u201cclarifying\u201d Section 230, which gives those services immunity from liability for user content while still allowing internet companies to moderate that content as they see fit. For example: If someone posts something defamatory about you on Facebook, you can sue that user but you can\u2019t sue Facebook. Ironically, this is the opposite of a light-touch framework, the legal justification for which rests on having a Title II authority over internet services that Pai decidedly didn\u2019t want and worked hard to remove. But Section 230 was a pet cause of President Trump, especially as social media platforms increasingly cracked down on accounts that spread misinformation. Trump was enraged, for instance, when his election-related tweets and Facebook posts were labeled with fact-checks. Conservatives have increasingly asserted that tech companies are biased against certain political viewpoints, although studies have shown that social media actually amplifies and spreads conservative content far more than liberal content. Trump issued an executive order in May asking the FCC to dictate what content platforms could moderate and how, in order to keep their Section 230 protections. In October, Pai issued a statement saying the FCC would do as Trump asked. With Biden\u2019s election, it\u2019s exceedingly unlikely this will happen. Pai\u2019s business-friendly FCC also tried to \u201cstrengthen local voices\u201d and modernize media ownership rules by increasing how many television and radio stations one company may own and allowing them to own different media outlets in the same market. Some of these rules were struck down in court.  Meanwhile, a proposed merger between conservative local television provider Sinclair Broadcast Group and Tribune Media Company, which would have put Sinclair stations in roughly 70 percent of American homes, fell apart when Sinclair lied about its plans to sell off stations in order to comply with FCC ownership regulations. Pai was an initial proponent of the Sinclair takeover \u2014 to the extent that he was investigated for showing preferential treatment to the company (he was cleared) \u2014 but would ultimately defy Trump and vote to block the merger. Sinclair ended up with a record $48 million fine from the FCC. Tribune\u2019s stations were sold to a different company, Nexstar, which then became the largest television station owner in the country. Pai\u2019s FCC also approved the Sprint/T-Mobile merger, which decreased the number of major American wireless carriers from four to three. Pai said the deal would speed up the rollout of 5G. He also took a hands-off approach to the Time Warner/AT&T merger, saying the FCC didn\u2019t need to review or approve it because it didn\u2019t involve the transfer of airwave licenses, effectively clearing the way for the massive media conglomerate despite the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust concerns. While Pai\u2019s FCC may not have done much for urban and lower-income Americans, it did provide billions in funding for access to broadband in rural and tribal communities and \u2014 despite delays and interagency fights \u2014 eventually begin to expand 5G service across the country.  With Pai\u2019s departure and Republican commissioner Michael O\u2019Rielly\u2019s term expiring at the end of the year, Biden will either begin his presidency with a 2-1 Democrat majority FCC or an FCC split along party lines. That depends on if Trump\u2019s nominee to replace O\u2019Rielly, Nathan Simington, is confirmed. Simington is seen as a major proponent of Trump\u2019s Section 230 executive order and didn\u2019t seem to be popular among Senate Democrats in his November confirmation hearing. Some Republicans have committed to voting for him, but a date for the vote has not yet been scheduled, and there isn\u2019t much time left. Should Simington not be confirmed, Trump appointee Brendan Carr would be left as the sole Republican commissioner on a three-person panel. Carr\u2019s statement about Pai\u2019s departure was significantly longer and more detailed than the other commissioners\u2019, saying that Pai \u201ccares deeply about the digital divide,\u201d thanking him for his \u201ccourageous and principled service to the country,\u201d and saying he would \u201cleave behind an [unparalleled] record of accomplishments \u2014 one that would not even fit in his oversized coffee mug.\u201d Open Sourced is made possible by Omidyar Network.

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the election result has sputtered out President Donald Trump still has not conceded his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden, but his bid to overturn the election results has sputtered out over the past week. The lawsuits of the Trump campaign and its allies have flopped. The key swing states Biden won have certified their results on schedule. And GOP state legislative leaders don\u2019t appear to be seriously trying to interfere with the appointment of electors. Trump is still, of course, trying his best to cast doubt on the results by making false claims of large-scale voter fraud. His latest gimmick is that his legal team is working with sympathetic Republican legislators in key states to hold press events touting supposed election irregularities. But no GOP-controlled legislature in a state Biden won seems to be making a serious push to overturn the result (a move that would entail many practical and legal obstacles). But the deadline in federal law for states to finalize their results is December 8 \u2014 Tuesday of next week. Then, the members of the Electoral College will meet (separately in each state) to cast their votes on December 14 \u2014 in just under two weeks. They are set to cast the votes that will officially make Biden the next president. And Trump has not yet been able to succeed in interfering with that process. There were six key swing states where Biden won by small margins, where Trump had hoped to interfere with the certification of results (certification is when a state makes its results official). Four of those six states \u2014 Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada \u2014 certified their results over the past week and a half, with Biden as the winner. The fifth and sixth, Arizona and Wisconsin, certified Biden\u2019s victory on Monday. Trump made political, procedural, and legal attempts to try and delay or interfere with these certifications, but these efforts have uniformly failed. Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, spurned the Trump team\u2019s attempts to get him to endorse fictitious claims of widespread voter fraud in the state. In Michigan, Trump allies\u2019 attempts to get two Republicans on the state board of canvassers to  block certification for similar reasons failed last week (one of them backed it).  In most of the other states, the key officials in charge of certifying results were Democrats, so Trump could only hope that a judge would step in and block certification. None have \u2014 so the Trump team\u2019s lawsuits flopped. Recounts have also failed to change the outcome. Wisconsin\u2019s recount of two counties has concluded, and Biden\u2019s lead of about 20,000 votes expanded by 87 votes. Georgia\u2019s new machine recount is still ongoing, but it isn\u2019t expected to change Biden\u2019s 12,000-vote lead since the ballots have already been audited by hand. After states certify their results, the next step in the process is that the electors are appointed. And this is key \u2014 the electors are the 538 people who compose the Electoral College and cast the votes that will officially determine the next president.  If Biden wins a state, he is entitled to have his chosen slate of people appointed as the electors for that state. But some Republicans have embraced the theory that the Constitution empowers state legislatures to ignore the outcome of the vote in their states and appoint whoever they want as electors instead.  Any effort to do this would run afoul of various state laws and arguably federal law as well. Legislators would essentially be asserting that the power granted them by the Constitution allows them to ignore these existing laws.  Some GOP state legislators have indeed come out in support of this, such as Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano (who met with Trump last week before abruptly leaving the meeting after he was informed he had tested positive for Covid-19). But GOP state legislative leaders have not come out in support of this effort, and most have outright said they won\u2019t. Pennsylvania\u2019s legislative leaders have no plans to put this on their legislative agenda. And Michigan\u2019s Republican leaders left a meeting with Trump earlier this month and said they would \u201cfollow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan\u2019s electors.\u201d And even though Trump\u2019s legal team worked with allied legislators in Pennsylvania and Arizona to hold purported \u201chearings\u201d about election irregularities in recent days, those weren\u2019t official legislative hearings \u2014 they were essentially press stunts.  So with neither the officials in charge of certifications nor Republican state legislative leaders willing to try to steal the election for Trump, it looks like the president\u2019s attempt to do just that is dead in the water.

    "article_text": "Even Amy Coney Barrett appears skeptical of Trump\u2019s latest attempt to rig the census If the Supreme Court decides to actually decide Trump v. New York, a case asking if President Trump can exclude undocumented immigrants from the 2020 census count, Trump is very likely to lose.  Both Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett appeared very skeptical of acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall\u2019s attempt to defend Trump\u2019s policy, which is unambiguously unconstitutional, during Monday\u2019s oral arguments. Add in the three liberal justices, and that\u2019s a majority of the Court that may be opposed to Trump\u2019s policy. Only Justice Samuel Alito offered much of a defense of it, so it\u2019s possible a ruling will be more lopsided than a 5-4 ruling. But the case is procedurally very messy. Several justices expressed doubts that the Court has jurisdiction to hear it now, though they could potentially take it up again after the census is finalized.  It\u2019s also unclear whether the Court should rule on this case on the expedited schedule originally proposed by Trump\u2019s Justice Department. The Justice Department had asked for the case to be decided before a December 31 statutory deadline to transmit the results of the 2020 census to Trump. But Wall seemed to concede early in Monday\u2019s arguments that the Commerce Department is \u201cnot currently on pace\u201d for that milestone, so Trump may not be able to meet a January 10 deadline to inform Congress of the new census\u2019s impact on representation in the US House of Representatives. President-elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, becomes president at noon on January 20. And once he becomes president, he can render this case moot by rescinding Trump\u2019s policy excluding undocumented immigrants from the census, assuming that the census has not been finalized by that point. The Trump administration, in other words, appears to be engaged in a disorganized race against the clock to implement an unconstitutional policy before Trump\u2019s term expires. And the justices appear uncertain about whether to end it now, or whether to let it play out and potentially invalidate Trump\u2019s policy later. The New York case turns on a memorandum Trump issued in July, which provides that \u201cfor the purpose of the reapportionment of Representatives following the 2020 census, it is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status.\u201d Thus, if Trump gets his way, undocumented immigrants will not be counted when House representation is doled out to each of the 50 states following the census. About 10.6 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States, and nearly 20 percent live in California. So the nation\u2019s largest blue state could lose as many as three House seats if Trump succeeds in his plans to cut these immigrants out of the apportionment count. (The Republican-leaning state of Texas could also be hit hard, but Texas\u2019s Republican legislature is likely to draw gerrymandered maps that would impose the cost of any lost House seats on Democrats. California, by contrast, uses a bipartisan redistricting commission to draw legislative lines.) Trump\u2019s memo violates the unambiguous text of the Constitution. Under the 14th Amendment, \u201crepresentatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.\u201d Undocumented immigrants are \u201cpersons.\u201d To get around this constitutional requirement, Trump claims that the 14th Amendment should not be read literally. \u201cAlthough the Constitution requires the \u2018persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed,\u2019 to be enumerated in the census,\u201d Trump says in his memo, \u201cthat requirement has never been understood to include in the apportionment base every individual physically present within a State\u2019s boundaries at the time of the census.\u201d On this narrow point, Trump is correct. There are some foreign nationals, such as tourists and foreign diplomats, who generally are not counted by the census, even if they are physically present when the census is being taken. \u201cThe term \u2018persons in each State,\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s memo notes, \u201chas been interpreted to mean that only the \u2018inhabitants\u2019 of each State should be included.\u201d Yet, while Trump is largely correct that only \u201cinhabitants\u201d of a state are counted for purposes of the census, Trump then claims a broad power to determine who counts as an inhabitant and who does not \u2014 and then he wields this assumed power to insist that undocumented immigrants are not inhabitants of the state where they reside. But this claim cannot be squared with the meaning of the word \u201cinhabitant.\u201d As the lower court that ruled against Trump in New York held, \u201cit does not follow that illegal aliens \u2014 a category defined by legal status, not residence \u2014 can be excluded\u201d from the census by claiming that they are not \u201cinhabitants\u201d of a state. \u201cTo the contrary,\u201d the court explained, while quoting from Merriam-Webster\u2019s dictionary, \u201cthe ordinary definition of the term \u2018inhabitant\u2019 is \u2018one that occupies a particular place regularly, routinely, or for a period of time.\u2019\u201d Many undocumented immigrants reside in a state for \u201cmany years or even decades,\u201d the court continued. Such individuals are clearly \u201cinhabitants\u201d of the state where they live, even if they are not lawfully present. Trump\u2019s newest appointee to the Court, Barrett, offered a forceful rebuttal to the attempt to defend Trump\u2019s policy. \u201cA lot of the historical evidence and longstanding practice really cuts against your position,\u201d Barrett told Wall. She added that there is evidence that \u201cin the founding era, an \u2018inhabitant\u2019 was a dweller, who lives and resides in a place.\u201d  Thus, an immigrant who has resided in a state for many months or years \u2014 or even one who has only lived there briefly \u2014 would count as an \u201cinhabitant.\u201d Kavanaugh, another Trump appointee, also said that he believes there are \u201cforceful constitutional and statutory arguments\u201d against Trump\u2019s position. So it is very likely that a majority of the Court will vote to reject Trump\u2019s policy \u2014 if, that is, the Court decides this case at all. The policy laid out in Trump\u2019s July memo is categorical. The memo states that \u201cit is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status.\u201d So, the memo suggests that any undocumented immigrant should be excluded from the census for apportionment purposes. But acting Solicitor General Wall spent time in oral arguments claiming that the administration isn\u2019t sure how many undocumented immigrants it will be able to identify, or whether Trump will try to exclude more than a \u201csubset\u201d of the estimated 10-11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. This subset, which might only include immigrants who are currently being detained with an eye towards removal, could be much smaller than the total number of undocumented immigrants in the country. The reason why the question of how many immigrants will be excluded matters is because of a doctrine known as \u201cstanding.\u201d Broadly speaking, a plaintiff may not challenge a federal policy unless they can show that there is a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that they will be injured by that policy. As a general rule, a state has standing to challenge a census-related policy if they are likely to lose House seats under that policy. But it is far more likely that one of the plaintiff states will lose representation if millions of undocumented immigrants are excluded from the census than if only maybe tens of thousands of immigrants are excluded. For this reason, several justices suggested that maybe the Court should wait to decide this case until after we know how many immigrants Trump will exclude. If the Court goes down that path, it\u2019s unclear what happens next. As noted above, Trump might not manage to send the final House appointment results to Congress before he leaves office. So the justices could be able to sit on this case until January 20, let President Biden rescind Trump\u2019s memo, and then declare the case moot. Alternatively, the Court could dismiss the case, let Trump do whatever he is going to do, and then the plaintiff states could file a new lawsuit as soon as Trump sends his apportionment results to Congress. Under this alternative outcome, Trump would win a temporary victory, but Trump\u2019s policy would still most likely fall victim to future litigation. Kavanaugh and Barrett also appeared to entertain a third possibility. The Court could strike down the categorical exclusion of undocumented immigrants laid out in Trump\u2019s July memorandum, but they could also permit Trump to issue a new memorandum that might exclude certain subcategories of undocumented immigrants (such as people currently in immigration detention). The plaintiff states could then file a new lawsuit challenging the legality of that new memorandum. In any event, it appears unlikely that Trump\u2019s original policy will stand. There appear to be at least five Supreme Court members \u2014 and potentially more than five \u2014 who think that Trump does not have the power to categorically exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment count. The open question is whether the Court will decide this case quickly, or whether they will string this case out, potentially raising a cloud of uncertainty over the apportionment process for months or more. Such a cloud could have significant costs, as it will cut into the time that states need to use to draw new congressional maps using the new census data. But, at the very least, Trump\u2019s unconstitutional policy looks likely to fall \u2014 eventually.",

    "article_text": "Trump\u2019s first interview since losing reelection was a smorgasbord of disinformation  President Donald Trump made his first television appearance since losing reelection on Sunday in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News\u2019s Sunday Morning Futures.  Over the course of 45 rambling minutes, Trump, mired in election denialism, used the platform to promulgate a slew of thoroughly disproven lies, disinformation, and conspiracy theories about nonexistent election fraud, aided and abetted by Bartiromo. Specifically, Trump trotted out his usual false claims about rigged voting machines and mail-in voting and shared overly optimistic takes on his many, many election lawsuits. He also held forth on a handful of random topics, including Iran and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. \u201cI was called by the biggest people saying congratulations, political people, congratulations, sir. You just won the election. It was 10 o\u2019clock and you looked at the numbers and I\u2019m sure you felt that way,\u201d Trump falsely told Bartiromo early in the segment when asked about his election fraud claims. \u201cThis election was over and then they did [ballot dumps], they call them dumps, big massive dumps in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and all over.\u201d In reality, those \u201cdumps\u201d were just mail-in votes being counted \u2014 something Trump had been told ahead of the election would add more votes to President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s vote total than to his, in part because he spent the weeks leading up to the election telling his supporters not to vote by mail. Trump also launched a confused and false attack on the upcoming Georgia Senate runoffs. Set for January 5, the two runoffs will decide control of the US Senate \u2014 if Democrats win both, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be able to provide the tie-breaking vote; however, if Republicans win even one, they will maintain a slim majority in the chamber. \u201cYou\u2019re using the same garbage machinery, Dominion, and [voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams is] going around, she\u2019s going around screaming she\u2019s got 800 or 850,000 ballots. What kind of an election is it?\u201d Trump said. It\u2019s not the first time Trump has attacked the integrity of the Georgia elections \u2014 he lost the state in the presidential election, the first time a Republican has done so since George H.W. Bush in 1992 \u2014 and as Vox\u2019s Aaron Rupar has explained, those attacks are engendering \u201cremarkably half-baked\u201d efforts by some Republican operatives to encourage GOP voters to sit out the runoffs. Trump has repeatedly questioned the competency of Georgia\u2019s election officials, casting doubt on their ability to conduct future contests \u2014 and has maintained, despite all evidence to the contrary, that voting machines and software made by Dominion Voting Systems changed votes cast for him in order to help Biden. He has been so successful pushing this particular conspiracy theory that Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel was forced to spend part of her trip to the state trying to convince Republican voters that they could trust the process and vote for the GOP Senate nominees in January. Trump, who spent the past three days golfing at one of his properties and only this Thursday answered a question from the press for the first time since Election Day, also told Bartiromo that he would \u201cuse 125 percent of my energy\u201d to prove voter fraud (which, again, has been shown not to exist to any meaningful degree) and overturn the results of the election. Trump\u2019s fusillade of inane lies, of course, has become more or less par for the course these days, but on Sunday, he wasn\u2019t screaming his conspiracies into the void of Twitter: instead, he had Bartiromo and a national audience. And Bartiromo didn\u2019t exactly attempt to push back on the president\u2019s assault on the most basic underpinnings of American democracy. In response to one Trump lie, for example \u2014 the president claiming falsely that \u201cthere\u2019s no way Joe Biden got 80 million votes ... there\u2019s no way it happened. This election was a fraud and it was a rigged election\u201d \u2014 Bartiromo didn\u2019t press for evidence supporting his claim or call out the lie in real time. Instead, she said that \u201cthis is disgusting, and we cannot allow America\u2019s election to be corrupted,\u201d then moved onto a new topic and offered up some conspiracy theories of her own. Bartiromo\u2019s acquiescence to Trump\u2019s disinformation peddling is especially striking on the heels of the president\u2019s repeated attacks on Fox News for not being sufficiently pro-Trump. \u201c@FoxNews daytime is virtually unwatchable, especially during the weekends,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday. \u201cWatch @OANN, @newsmax, or almost anything else.\u201d Whatever the president\u2019s mercurial opinion of Fox, though, the reality bears repeating: Joe Biden won well over 80 million votes, beating out Trump by more than 6 million, and the election was neither a fraud nor rigged. That all happened, no matter what the president says, and Biden will take office in January 2021. Unfortunately, Trump\u2019s voter fraud rhetoric has taken deep root in the Republican Party. Recent polls \u2014 including one conducted by Vox and Data for Progress on November 16 \u2014 show that majorities of Republican voters believe there was fraud in the 2020 presidential election (there wasn\u2019t). In the case of the Vox/Data for Progress poll, fully 75 percent of likely GOP voters agreed that \u201cthere was voter fraud during the election that helped former Vice President Joe Biden.\u201d  For all of the president\u2019s frantic protestations, he\u2019s quickly running out of time to dispute the election results. States \u2014 including Pennsylvania \u2014 are beginning to certify their results, and the federal certification deadline is approaching on December 8. After that, the Electoral College will meet on December 14, and Biden will be formally elected as the next president. In both Wisconsin and Georgia \u2014 swing states won by Biden \u2014 recounts have confirmed the former vice president\u2019s victory. Lawsuits intended to overturn the will of the people in states like Pennsylvania have been slapped down in courts, with even Trump-nominated judges rejecting his lawyers\u2019 arguments. One such judge, Stephanos Bibas, wrote in a Friday decision handed down by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals that \u201cthe Campaign cannot win this lawsuit. It conceded that it is not alleging election fraud. It has already raised and lost most of these state-law issues, and it cannot relitigate them here.\u201d Separately, in Sunday\u2019s interview, Trump told Bartiromo that Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Mike Kelly had \u201ca great case\u201d to invalidate mail-in ballots in the state \u201cbecause the legislature didn\u2019t make the decision on this stuff.\u201d Not only was Kelly\u2019s case dismissed with prejudice by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Saturday, but the president misstated the facts of the case to Bartiromo \u2014 the state legislature passed vote-by-mail into law in 2019. A trip to the US Supreme Court will also likely prove futile for the president, experts say, if any Trump campaign lawsuit makes it that far in the first place. After Trump campaign senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis pledged to appeal the campaign\u2019s Third Circuit loss to the Supreme Court in a tweet Friday, University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck pointed out that \u201cany appeal is [dead on arrival],\u201d even with a new 6-3 conservative majority on the Court. The transition to a Biden administration has also officially begun: General Services Administration chief Emily Murphy ascertained the election results Monday after public outcry over the delay, and federal funding has been made available to the Biden-Harris transition team. So as damaging as Trump\u2019s tweets and Sunday interview might be to confidence in American democracy, there\u2019s no reason to believe they will lead to anything but President Joe Biden on January 20, 2021.",

    "article_text": "The Pennsylvania Supreme Court just dismissed a GOP bid to overturn the election President Donald Trump\u2019s terrible week in court continued Saturday with yet another adverse ruling from a Pennsylvania court. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a suit brought by Rep. Mike Kelly and other Republicans challenging the state\u2019s mail-in voting law \u2014 passed in October 2019 \u2014 was filed too long after the law was passed, and because of that, rejected a requested review of the law. \u201cThe want of due diligence demonstrated in this matter is unmistakable,\u201d the court wrote in an unsigned per curiam opinion. \u201cPetitioners filed this facial challenge to the mail-in voting statutory provisions more than one year after the enactment of Act 77.\u201d The court also overturned a lower court injunction blocking Pennsylvania from moving ahead with certifying its election. The suit was dismissed with prejudice, putting a permanent end to that avenue of challenge. As Democratic voting-rights lawyer Marc Elias pointed out on Twitter, the lawsuit, had it succeeded, would have had an additional, likely unintended effect: It would also have blocked certification of Kelly\u2019s own election results in Pennsylvania\u2019s 16th District. Pennsylvania certified its presidential election results on Tuesday, sealing President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s win in the crucial swing state. But a judge instituted a temporary injunction on the certification that same day \u2014 one the secretary of state planned to challenge in the state Supreme Court. With Saturday\u2019s ruling, that certification is cleared to proceed. Biden beat Trump by more than 80,000 votes in the final tally to claim Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 electoral votes. Kelly was joined in the suit by onetime Pennsylvania congressional candidate Sean Parnell and six other state residents, including a state House candidate who claimed just 5.5 percent of the vote in her last race. The plaintiffs alleged that the state\u2019s mail-in voting law was flat-out unconstitutional, and proposed two possible remedies: either the invalidation of all mail ballots cast in the election or allowing the Republican-controlled Pennsylvania general assembly to select a slate of presidential electors, rather than Pennsylvania voters. Either remedy would have disenfranchised voters on a scale unprecedented in the modern era, while handing the state to Trump \u2014 and both were rejected out of hand by the court. \u201cIt is beyond cavil that Petitioners failed to act with due diligence in presenting the instant claim,\u201d the court wrote. \u201cEqually clear is the substantial prejudice arising from Petitioners\u2019 failure to institute promptly a facial challenge to the mail-in voting statutory scheme, as such inaction would result in the disenfranchisement of millions of Pennsylvania voters.\u201d As Pennsylvania Lieutenant Gov. John Fetterman pointed out in a tweet after the state Supreme Court decision was published, Saturday\u2019s ruling is by no means the only recent loss by the Trump campaign and GOP members looking to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. In Pennsylvania alone last week, the Trump campaign lost twice in quick succession in federal court. Most recently, a Trump-nominated judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Stephanos Bibas, wrote in a scathing decision that the president\u2019s lawsuit challenging Pennsylvania election results had \u201cno merit.\u201d \u201cFree, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy,\u201d Bibas wrote in the 21-page unanimous decision. \u201cCharges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.\u201d In total, the president\u2019s flailing legal strategy has resulted in a 1-39 record before various state and federal courts around the country, according to Elias. No evidence of voter fraud or other irregularities has surfaced anywhere, despite false claims by Trump and his allies otherwise, and a federal election certification deadline on December 8 is closing in. That, however, hasn\u2019t put a damper on the president\u2019s nonsensical arguments about election fraud. \u201cThe number of ballots that our Campaign is challenging in the Pennsylvania case is FAR LARGER than the 81,000 vote margin. It\u2019s not even close. Fraud and illegality ARE a big part of the case,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter Saturday, though there is no evidence of any fraud or illegality and Pennsylvania has already certified its election results. Even as Republican court challenges fail, other potential avenues for Trump to overturn the election results \u2014 and the democratic process \u2014 are fading fast. In particular, one fringe theory promulgated by Trump holds that Republican-controlled state legislatures, like the one in Pennsylvania, can appoint their own slate of Trump electors, regardless of how the state voted. Trump tweeted as much last week, writing that \u201chopefully the Courts and/or Legislatures will have the COURAGE to do what has to be done,\u201d and Republicans hoped the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would pave the way for the legislature to get involved there. It\u2019s not, however, a feasible scheme. Beyond the fact that the court rejected the idea, the theory isn\u2019t backed by anything \u201ceven remotely close to a relevant majority\u201d of state lawmakers, and even if it were, it would certainly face a veto from Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic governor and a swift series of legal challenges. That the US Supreme Court might somehow overturn the election results \u2014 a strategy alluded to by Trump senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis in a Friday tweet after the campaign\u2019s Third Circuit loss \u2014 is also vanishingly unlikely to succeed. According to University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck, \u201cthe Trump campaign has the right to ask #SCOTUS to review this decision, and it has the right to ask the Court for an injunction pending appeal. But as Judge Bibas\u2019s opinion makes clear, try as they might, this lawsuit has no chance of succeeding.\u201d Ultimately, the Trump campaign never had evidence for its claims of fraud, as a number of judges and justices have now pointed out. And its other efforts have failed, or are actively in the process of failing, as states move forward with certifying their election results. The president may keep tweeting otherwise \u2014 but starting at noon on January 20, 2021, he won\u2019t be the president any longer. Biden will be.",

    "article_text": "Federal appeals court rejects a Trump election lawsuit: \u201cCalling an election unfair does not make it so\u201d President Donald Trump continued to misleadingly cast doubt on the results of the 2020 presidential election \u2014 which was won three weeks ago by President-elect Joe Biden \u2014 in the early hours of Saturday morning. But with lawsuit after lawsuit failing in courts, and the federal election certification deadline approaching, Trump is quickly running out of road to attempt overturning the election. The president\u2019s latest legal defeat came Friday when a three-member appeals court rejected a Trump campaign suit against Pennsylvania election officials that alleged the state engaged in \u201cunconstitutional discrimination\u201d against Trump voters in a scathing, unanimous decision that found the president\u2019s lawsuit had \u201cno merit.\u201d Specifically, the suit asked two things of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals: to reverse a lower court decision blocking Trump\u2019s legal team from amending its complaint to include claims that poll watchers were barred from observing the vote counting process, and to issue an injunction \u201cto prevent the certified vote totals from taking effect.\u201d (Pennsylvania certified its election results on Tuesday.) The court granted neither. In its decision, the court highlighted the Trump legal team\u2019s lack of evidence of its claims, and rebuked the lawyers for making \u201cvague and conclusory\u201d allegations, and for requesting a remedy \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the procedural challenges raised.\u201d \u201cThe Campaign never alleges that any ballot was fraudulent or cast by an illegal voter,\u201d Judge Stephanos Bibas, who was nominated to the court by Trump in 2017, wrote for the court. \u201cIt never alleges that any defendant treated the Trump campaign or its votes worse than it treated the Biden campaign or its votes. Calling something discrimination does not make it so.\u201d \u201cCharges of unfairness are serious,\u201d Bibas wrote. \u201cBut calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.\u201d Previously, Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania lawsuit was dismissed in federal district court in a similar, equally scorching decision by Judge Matthew Brann, who wrote that \u201cthis Court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence.\u201d In a tweet after the decision was published, Trump campaign legal adviser Jenna Ellis, who in 2016 referred to Trump as an \u201cunethical, corrupt, lying, criminal, dirtbag,\u201d decried the \u201cactivist judicial machinery in Pennsylvania.\u201d \u201cOn to SCOTUS,\u201d Ellis wrote Friday. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that the Supreme Court will accept the case if the Trump campaign follows through on an appeal, experts say, and even less that the Court would rule in its favor. \u201cYes, the Trump campaign can now \u2018go to #SCOTUS,\u2019 but with what?\u201d wrote University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck on Twitter. \u201cThe Court is never going to take up this dumpster-fire of a lawsuit. And, as today\u2019s unanimous Third Circuit opinion written by a Trump appointee makes clear, there\u2019s no remote basis for an injunction pending appeal.\u201d The Trump campaign faces equally slim chances of success elsewhere. Though it is determined to pursue lawsuits in other swing states, Trump\u2019s legal team has fared poorly thus far: In total, its post-election record in court stands at 1-38, according to Democratic voting rights lawyer Marc Elias, who writes the campaign is \u201con a solid pace to lose 50 before the Electors meet in December.\u201d Even before the Electoral College meets on December 14, there is a rapidly approaching federal deadline for state certification of election results on December 8. According to the New York Times, \u201cif states resolve all disputes and certify their results\u201d by that deadline, \u201cthe results should be insulated from further legal challenges, ensuring that states won by Mr. Biden will send Biden delegates to the Electoral College.\u201d That certification will essentially make the president\u2019s legal challenges moot. And the meeting of the Electoral College the subsequent week will slam the door even more firmly in the face of Trump\u2019s inane voter fraud claims. Biden won 74 more electoral votes than Trump \u2014 36 more than the bare minimum needed to win the presidency. It is possible, although very unlikely, that some electors in states won by Biden choose to cast their votes for Trump \u2014 but as the Times points out, \u201crogue electors have been few and far between, and have never altered the outcome.\u201d Though the Trump campaign has failed time and time again to provide any evidence of voter fraud in court, that hasn\u2019t stopped the president and his lawyers from lying outrageously about the legitimacy of the election. Of late, their falsehoods have included a wide range of nonsense conspiracy theories, ranging from ballots for Biden being \u201ccreated out of thin air\u201d to former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez helping to rig election machines before his death in 2013. And even in the exceedingly rare occasions since Election Day where Trump has come close to acknowledging the reality of his loss, he\u2019s married that acknowledgement with yet more false, baseless fraud claims. \u201c[Biden] won because the Election was Rigged,\u201d Trump tweeted earlier this month. He took a similar line in public remarks Thursday, when asked by reporters if he intended to leave the White House when Biden took office. \u201cCertainly, I will. And you know that. But I think that there will be a lot of things happening between now and the 20th of January,\u201d Trump said, according to a transcript provided by the White House. \u201cMassive fraud has been found. We\u2019re like a third-world country.\u201d For all of Trump\u2019s hedging, Biden\u2019s margin is only growing. On Friday, a recount requested and paid for by the Trump campaign in two Wisconsin counties saw the former vice president pick up 132 new votes. All told, Biden\u2019s national popular vote margin now stands at well over 6 million votes. And on Monday, the General Services Administration \u2014 the government agency in charge of \u201cascertaining\u201d a presidential win to make government resources available to a transition team \u2014 authorized the Biden transition to begin. Trump didn\u2019t let that pass unheeded either: \u201c[GSA administrator] Emily Murphy has done a great job, but the GSA does not determine who the next President of the United States will be,\u201d he tweeted Tuesday. On that, he\u2019s right, if only technically. \u201cVoters, not lawyers, choose the President,\u201d Bibas wrote in his decision rejecting the Trump campaign appeal. \u201cBallots, not briefs, decide elections.\u201d And those voters have decided \u2014 regardless of what Trump claims \u2014 that Biden will be the next president of the United States.",
